  # FairForm ¬∑ Legal GPS MVP

  Guided civil justice for self-represented litigants.
</div>

## Overview

This repository hosts the Phase 1 MVP for **FairForm**, a mobile-first Next.js 14 application that pairs Firebase Auth and Firestore with an accessible Tailwind + shadcn/ui design system. The implementation follows the product, design, and technical blueprints in `/docs`.

Key highlights:

- App Router (`/app`) with first-class server components.
- Tailwind CSS configured with FairForm brand tokens and shadcn/ui primitives.
- React Hook Form + Zod ready for conversational workflows.
- Placeholder routes for `/dashboard` and `/docs` to support Sprint 1 planning.

## Requirements

- Node.js ‚â• 18.18 (tested on v24.9.0)
- npm (bundled with Node)

Optional tooling for contributors:

- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Vercel CLI (`npm install -g vercel`)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local # fill with Firebase, Twilio, Resend, PostHog values
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the MVP shell. The landing page summarises sprint goals, and `/docs` lists the authoritative specifications.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build |
| `npm run start` | Run the production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run Next.js lint checks |
| `npm run type-check` | Validate TypeScript types |

## Project Structure

```
app/            # App Router routes, layouts, and global styles
components/     # shadcn/ui components and FairForm UI primitives
docs/           # Product, design, and delivery documentation
lib/            # Shared utilities (firebase, repos, notifications to come)
public/         # Static assets
```

Upcoming directories (`lib/firebase`, `app/(auth)`, `components/cards`) follow the Technical Implementation Plan and will be introduced as Sprint 1 tasks complete.

## Documentation

The `/docs` folder holds the authoritative source material:

- `‚öñÔ∏è FairForm ‚Äì Product Requirements Document (PRD).md`
- `üé® FairForm ‚Äì Design Specification.md`
- `‚öôÔ∏è FairForm ‚Äì Technical Implementation Plan.md`
- `‚öôÔ∏è FairForm ‚Äì Sprint 1 Backlog.md`

Review these documents before implementing new features to stay aligned with compliance, tone, and accessibility requirements.

## Conventions

- **TypeScript first** with strict mode enabled.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA baseline; use focus-visible utilities and semantic HTML.
- **Design tokens**: Use the Tailwind utility classes derived from CSS variables in `app/globals.css`.
- **Imports**: Use `@/` alias (root) for absolute paths.

## Deployment

Production hosting will run on Vercel. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (staging + production) and enable preview deployments per pull request. GitHub Actions and Firebase integrations will be added as soon as backend services land.

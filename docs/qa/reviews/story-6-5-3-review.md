- ✅ currentStep > totalSteps → returns completion tasks

**Component Edge Cases:**
- ✅ Loading state → shows spinner
- ✅ Error state → shows error message
- ✅ Empty next steps → shows contextual message
- ✅ No case data → shows loading skeleton
- ✅ Invalid props → handles gracefully

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Generation errors don't crash UI
- ✅ Missing data handled with defaults
- ✅ React Query errors displayed to user
- ✅ Retry functionality available

**Edge Case Assessment:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

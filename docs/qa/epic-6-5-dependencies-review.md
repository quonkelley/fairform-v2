## Part 1: Technical Approach Review

### 1.1 Epic 6 Integration Analysis

**Current State (Epic 6 - Stories 6.1-6.4):**
- ‚úÖ Story 6.1: Case Journey Visual Timeline (Done, QA: PASS)
  - Repository pattern established: `stepsRepo.ts`
  - React Query hook: `useCaseSteps`
  - Components: `CaseJourneyMap`, `StepNode`
  - Test coverage: 59/59 tests passing
  - Accessibility: 0 violations
  
- ‚úÖ Story 6.2: Step Completion Logic (Done, QA: PASS)
  - Optimistic updates with React Query
  - Progress sync mechanism
  - Repository methods for step completion
  
- üìã Story 6.3: Step Detail Modal (Ready for dev)
  - `StepDetailModal` component
  - Hardcoded Small Claims instructions
  - Modal trigger integration
  
- üìã Story 6.4: Dashboard Progress Sync (Ready for dev)
  - `progressPct`, `completedSteps`, `totalSteps` fields
  - Dashboard card updates
  - Real-time progress calculation

**Epic 6.5 Integration Points:**

| Epic 6.5 Component | Integrates With Epic 6 | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------|------------|
| Status Adapter | `CaseJourneyMap`, `StepNode` | LOW | Adapter is UI-only, doesn't change DB |
| Case Type Field | Firestore `cases` collection | MEDIUM | New optional field, backward compatible |
| Progress Overview | Story 6.4 progress fields | LOW | Uses existing fields, new component |
| Two-Column Layout | `CaseJourneyMap` component | MEDIUM | Major UI change, needs regression testing |
| Next Steps Panel | Case progress state | LOW | New component, no changes to existing |

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Integration approach is sound with clear separation of concerns.

---

### 1.2 Case Detail Realignment Validation

**Alignment with Realignment Plan (`case_detail_realignment.md`):**

| Realignment Item | Epic 6.5 Story | Status | Notes |
|------------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Data & Adapters** | Story 6.5.1 | ‚úÖ ALIGNED | Status adapter matches plan exactly |
| **Template Registry** | Story 6.5.2 | ‚úÖ ALIGNED | Case type templates as specified |
| **Next Steps Panel** | Story 6.5.3 | ‚úÖ ALIGNED | Rule-based generator, no AI |
| **Layout Upgrade** | Story 6.5.4 | ‚úÖ ALIGNED | Two-column grid with mobile stack |
| **Repo Updates** | Story 6.5.1 | ‚úÖ ALIGNED | `currentStep` calculation included |

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚ùå **No Gaps Found** - Epic 6.5 comprehensively covers the realignment plan
- ‚úÖ **Scope Control** - Epic correctly excludes out-of-scope items (AI features, dynamic templates from DB)

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Epic 6.5 fully implements the realignment plan without scope creep.

### 1.3 Regression Risk Assessment

**Potential Regression Risks:**

#### Risk 1: CaseJourneyMap Component Changes
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Broken timeline display, lost step navigation

**Affected Code:**
- `app/cases/[id]/page.tsx` - Major layout restructure
- `components/case-journey/case-journey-map.tsx` - Integration with new layout

**Mitigation:**
- Preserve existing `CaseJourneyMap` component interface
- Add regression test suite before Epic 6.5 work begins
- Test step navigation and modal triggers after layout changes
- Verify all Story 6.1 and 6.2 tests still pass

**QA Requirements:**
- [ ] Run full Story 6.1 test suite (59 tests)
- [ ] Run full Story 6.2 test suite
- [ ] Manual smoke test of case journey timeline
- [ ] Verify `StepDetailModal` still opens correctly

---

#### Risk 2: Repository Pattern Changes
**Severity:** LOW  
**Probability:** LOW  
**Impact:** Data fetching broken, progress calculation errors

**Affected Code:**
- `lib/db/casesRepo.ts` - Adding `currentStep`, `caseType` support
- `lib/db/stepsRepo.ts` - Potential template generation integration

**Mitigation:**
- New fields are additive only
- Existing methods remain unchanged
- Status adapter doesn't touch repository layer

**QA Requirements:**
- [ ] Unit tests for new repository methods
- [ ] Integration tests for data fetching
- [ ] Verify existing React Query hooks still work

---

#### Risk 3: Mobile Responsiveness
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Broken mobile experience, unusable on small screens

**Affected Code:**
- `app/cases/[id]/page.tsx` - Two-column to single-column stacking
- All new components must be mobile-first

**Mitigation:**
- Mobile-first development approach
- Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Responsive design system utilities (Tailwind)
- Keyboard navigation order preserved on mobile

**QA Requirements:**
- [ ] Test on iPhone (Safari) - 375px, 414px widths
- [ ] Test on Android (Chrome) - 360px, 412px widths
- [ ] Test landscape and portrait orientations
- [ ] Verify touch targets ‚â• 44x44px
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation order on mobile

---

#### Risk 4: Accessibility Regressions
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Probability:** LOW  
**Impact:** WCAG violations, broken screen reader experience

**Affected Code:**
- All new components must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Layout changes could break keyboard navigation

**Mitigation:**

- Maintain keyboard navigation patterns
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)

**QA Requirements:**
- [ ] Zero jest-axe violations (target: 0)
- [ ] Screen reader testing on new components
- [ ] Keyboard navigation flow verification
- [ ] Focus management in two-column layout

---

### 1.4 Template Content Review

**Legal Accuracy Concerns:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FINDING:** Template content for Small Claims and future case types requires legal review to ensure:
- Procedural steps are legally accurate
- Jurisdiction-specific requirements are correct
- No Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) violations
- Disclaimers are prominent and appropriate

**Small Claims Template Review (Story 6.5.2):**

| Template Field | Risk Level | Review Required |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Step Titles | LOW | Generic, procedurally accurate |
| Step Descriptions | MEDIUM | Should be legally reviewed |
| Instructions | HIGH | Must not constitute legal advice |
| Estimated Times | LOW | User guidance only |
| Step Types | LOW | Metadata only |

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - [ ] Add prominent disclaimer: "This is general information, not legal advice"
   - [ ] Use "typically" or "generally" language to avoid absolutes
   - [ ] Include jurisdiction caveats (e.g., "In most California small claims courts...")
   - [ ] Add "Consult local court for specific requirements" messaging

2. **Before Production:**
   - [ ] Legal counsel review of all template content
   - [ ] Focus group testing with actual SRLs
   - [ ] Jurisdiction-specific validation (start with California)

3. **Template Content Guidelines:**
   - ‚úÖ DO: Provide procedural guidance and general information
   - ‚úÖ DO: Link to official court resources
   - ‚úÖ DO: Use disclaimers prominently
   - ‚ùå DON'T: Give specific legal advice
   - ‚ùå DON'T: Interpret laws or statutes
   - ‚ùå DON'T: Make guarantees about outcomes

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** - Proceed with development using safe, general language. Legal review required before production deployment.

### 2.2 Regression Test Requirements

**Epic 6 Regression Test Suite:**

Before Epic 6.5 development, establish baseline:

```bash
# Epic 6 Regression Suite
- Story 6.1 Tests: 59 tests (100% pass required)
- Story 6.2 Tests: [count from implementation]
- Story 6.3 Tests: [pending completion]
- Story 6.4 Tests: [pending completion]

Total Baseline: [count] tests
Target: 100% pass rate maintained throughout Epic 6.5
```

**Regression Test Strategy:**

1. **Pre-Epic 6.5:**
   - [ ] Run full Epic 6 test suite
   - [ ] Document current test count and pass rate
   - [ ] Take screenshots of working functionality
   - [ ] Record Lighthouse scores (performance baseline)

2. **During Each Story:**
   - [ ] Run Epic 6 regression suite before starting
   - [ ] Run regression suite after each major change
   - [ ] Fix any broken tests immediately
   - [ ] Update tests if intentional behavior changes

3. **Post-Epic 6.5:**
   - [ ] Run combined Epic 6 + 6.5 test suite
   - [ ] Compare performance metrics (no degradation)
   - [ ] Visual regression testing (screenshots)
   - [ ] Manual smoke test checklist

---

### 2.3 Accessibility Audit Approach

**Automated Testing:**

```typescript
// Run on all new components
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('ProgressOverview has no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<ProgressOverview {...props} />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});

// Repeat for: NextStepsCard, updated CaseJourneyMap
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Tab order is logical through two-column layout
  - Focus visible on all interactive elements
  - Modal can be opened and closed via keyboard
  - Next steps cards keyboard accessible

- [ ] **Screen Reader Testing (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac):**
  - Page structure announced correctly
  - Progress percentage announced
  - Next steps list announced with proper semantics
  - Case journey timeline maintains screen reader support
  - Modal announcements work correctly

- [ ] **Color Contrast:**
  - All text meets 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA)
  - Status indicators don't rely solely on color
  - Links have 3:1 contrast with surrounding text

- [ ] **Zoom Testing:**
  - Page usable at 200% zoom
  - No horizontal scrolling required
  - Text reflows appropriately

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Checklist:**

| WCAG Criterion | Test Method | Target |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 1.3.1 Info & Relationships | Screen reader | PASS |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | Contrast checker | ‚â•4.5:1 |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | Manual testing | PASS |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Tab through UI | Logical |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | Visual check | Visible |
| 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation | Manual check | Consistent |
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | Screen reader | PASS |

**Target:** Zero WCAG 2.1 AA violations

  - All touch targets ‚â• 44x44px
  - Keyboard navigation order is logical
```

**Scenario 4: Template System Integration**
```
Given: Case has caseType = 'small_claims'
When: Journey generation runs
Then:
  - Correct template is selected
  - 5 Small Claims steps are generated
  - Step types match template
  - Next steps generated match current step
  - Template registry supports future case types
```

**Scenario 5: Progress Calculation Accuracy**
```
Given: Case with 5 steps, 2 completed
When: Progress is calculated

### 2.5 Performance Testing Strategy

**Performance Targets:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Page Load Time (3G) | ‚â§ 1.5s | Lighthouse, Network throttling |
| Time to Interactive | ‚â§ 3.8s | Lighthouse |
| First Contentful Paint | ‚â§ 1.8s | Lighthouse |
| Largest Contentful Paint | ‚â§ 2.5s | Lighthouse |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | ‚â§ 0.1 | Lighthouse |
| Modal Open Time | ‚â§ 100ms | Performance API |
| Status Adapter Performance | ‚â§ 50ms | Performance API |
| Next Steps Generation | ‚â§ 100ms | Performance API |

**Performance Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on mobile (target: ‚â•95)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on desktop (target: ‚â•95)
- [ ] Test with slow 3G network throttling
- [ ] Measure component render times
- [ ] Profile React Query cache behavior
- [ ] Test with large datasets (100+ steps)
- [ ] Memory leak testing (long sessions)

**Performance Regression Prevention:**

```javascript
// Add performance marks
performance.mark('nextSteps-start');
const nextSteps = generateNextSteps(caseType, currentStep);
performance.mark('nextSteps-end');
performance.measure('nextSteps-generation', 'nextSteps-start', 'nextSteps-end');

// Assert performance in tests
expect(performance.getEntriesByName('nextSteps-generation')[0].duration).toBeLessThan(100);
```

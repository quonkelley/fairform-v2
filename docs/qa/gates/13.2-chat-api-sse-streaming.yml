nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Post-call moderation now implemented for both SSE and JSON paths. Safe fallback messages used. Moderation blocking properly emitted and persisted.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SSE retry integration complete with exponential backoff. Streaming provides fast TTFB. Token estimation fallback functional.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Retry logic unified for streaming and JSON modes. Structured error events emitted. Session case syncing works correctly. 20/20 tests passing.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'TypeScript compilation errors reduce maintainability. Explicit any types compromise type safety. Good test coverage (20 tests). Code structure is clean.'

previous_issues_resolved:
  - issue: 'SSE responses never pass through post-call moderation'
    resolution: 'Added moderateAssistantOutput() at line 386, integrated at line 307, emits moderation_blocked event, stores safe fallback'
    verification: 'Test coverage added, all 20 tests pass'
  - issue: 'Streaming OpenAI calls bypass retry/backoff logic'
    resolution: 'SSE path now calls chatCompletionWithRetry with stream=true (line 276), exponential backoff applies, error events emitted (lines 354-368)'
    verification: 'Retry logic validated for both streaming and JSON modes'
  - issue: 'Existing sessions ignore provided caseId'
    resolution: 'Added updateSessionCase to aiSessionsRepo (lines 148-162), integrated at lines 183-185'
    verification: 'Test coverage added, session syncing works correctly'
  - issue: 'TypeScript compilation errors in JSON handler'
    resolution: 'Added function overloads (lines 98-108) with ChatCompletionStream and ChatCompletionResult types, type assertion at line 435'
    verification: 'Zero TypeScript errors in route.ts, proper type inference'
  - issue: 'ESLint violations with explicit any types'
    resolution: 'Replaced all any with proper types: unknown for errors (line 124), AISession for session params (lines 247, 422), type guard for streams (line 169)'
    verification: 'Zero ESLint errors: "✔ No ESLint warnings or errors"'

verification_results:
  tests:
    status: PASS
    details: '20/20 tests passing (3.13s). Full coverage of all acceptance criteria including moderation, retry, session management, SSE streaming, and JSON fallback.'
  type_check:
    status: PASS_WITH_EXTERNAL_ISSUES
    details: 'Zero TypeScript errors in Story 13.2 code (route.ts). 17 errors in lib/ai/contextBuilder.test.ts are Story 13.3 issues.'

  future:
    - action: 'Consider using tiktoken library for accurate token counting instead of text.length/4 estimation'
      refs: ['app/api/ai/copilot/chat/route.ts:410-415']
    - action: 'Add structured logging for moderation blocks to improve observability'
    - action: 'Add metrics tracking for SSE connection durations and retry rates'

story_13_3_coordination:
  note: 'Story 13.3 context builder has 17 type errors requiring coordination with other developer'
  affected_files: ['lib/ai/contextBuilder.test.ts', 'lib/ai/contextBuilder.ts', 'lib/db/usersRepo.ts']
  root_causes:
    - 'User type mock data missing required fields (email, displayName, createdAt, role)'
    - 'Case type mock data missing userId and proper Date objects'
    - 'UserPreferences interface missing timeZone property'
    - 'PaginatedMessages mocks missing hasMore property'
  recommendation: 'Create separate Story 13.3 QA gate and coordinate type definition updates'

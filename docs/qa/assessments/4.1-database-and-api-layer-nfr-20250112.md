Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: FAIL - No authentication implementation
- Performance: CONCERNS - No performance requirements defined
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Error handling needs improvement
- Maintainability: PASS - Good code structure and testing

## Critical Issues

1. **No Authentication Implementation** (Security)
   - Risk: Complete security bypass
   - Fix: Implement Firebase Auth integration immediately

2. **Missing Ownership Validation** (Security)
   - Risk: Cross-user data access
   - Fix: Add ownership checks to all repository methods

3. **Incomplete Error Handling** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Poor user experience on failures
   - Fix: Standardize error response formats

## Quick Wins

- Implement authentication: ~4 hours
- Add ownership validation: ~2 hours
- Fix test failures: ~2 hours
- Deploy Firestore security rules: ~1 hour

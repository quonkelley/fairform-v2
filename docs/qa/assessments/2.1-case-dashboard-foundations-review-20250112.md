3. **User Interactions** - Case creation flow and navigation
4. **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Integration** - Route protection and authentication flow

## Risk Assessment

### Security Risks: NONE IDENTIFIED
- Proper ownership enforcement in data access
- No client-side data exposure vulnerabilities
- Secure form validation and error handling

### Performance Risks: NONE IDENTIFIED
- Efficient data fetching and caching
- Proper loading states prevent UI blocking
- Responsive design handles various screen sizes

### Reliability Risks: NONE IDENTIFIED
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Graceful degradation for network failures
- Proper fallback mechanisms

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: NONE REQUIRED

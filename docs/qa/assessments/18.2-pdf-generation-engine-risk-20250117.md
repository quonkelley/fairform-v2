Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 0
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 100/100 (minimal risk)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks
- Technical: 0 risks

### By Component

- PDF Generation: 0 risks
- HTML Fallback: 0 risks
- Validation: 0 risks
- Template Loading: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

No risks identified. The PDF generation system is well-architected with:

- Safe PDF generation using established library (pdf-lib)
- Comprehensive input validation
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- No external dependencies beyond template loading
- No sensitive data handling beyond form fields
- Proper HTML escaping in fallback system

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

No critical risks identified - all tests are standard functional tests.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

No high risks identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

All existing tests cover the appropriate risk levels:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Error scenario testing
- Edge case coverage

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

No critical risks requiring fixes.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

No risks requiring mitigation.

### Accepted Risks

No risks identified that require acceptance.

## Monitoring Requirements

No specific monitoring required beyond standard application monitoring.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New PDF field types are added
- External PDF template sources are introduced
- Sensitive data handling is added
- Performance requirements change significantly

## Key Principles

- Risk assessment focused on PDF generation safety
- No external API dependencies beyond template loading
- Comprehensive validation prevents data corruption
- HTML fallback provides reliable degradation path

Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 65/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: No Authentication Implementation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - All API endpoints use mock user ID
**Impact**: High - Complete security bypass, unauthorized access to all data
**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper Firebase Auth integration immediately
- Add session validation to all API endpoints
- Remove mock user ID usage
**Testing Focus**: Security testing with authentication scenarios

## High Risks

### 2. SEC-002: Missing Ownership Validation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Ownership checks are commented out
**Impact**: High - Users could access/modify other users' data
**Mitigation**:
- Implement ownership validation in all repository methods
- Add case ownership checks before step operations
- Verify user owns case before reminder creation
**Testing Focus**: Authorization testing with cross-user scenarios

### 3. DATA-001: Incomplete Firestore Security Rules

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Security rules not implemented in Firestore
**Impact**: High - Database-level security bypass
**Mitigation**:
- Deploy Firestore security rules from data model specification
- Test rules with authenticated and unauthenticated requests
- Verify ownership enforcement at database level
**Testing Focus**: Firestore security rule testing

## Medium Risks

### 4. TEST-001: Test Coverage Gaps

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Some test failures observed
**Impact**: Medium - Unknown behavior in edge cases
**Mitigation**:
- Fix failing repository tests (createStep, createReminder)
- Add integration tests for ownership validation
- Increase test coverage to meet standards (≥80% repositories, ≥70% APIs)
**Testing Focus**: Comprehensive test suite execution

### 5. REL-001: Error Handling Inconsistencies

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Some error paths not fully tested
**Impact**: Medium - Poor user experience on failures
**Mitigation**:
- Standardize error response formats across all endpoints
- Add comprehensive error handling tests
- Ensure all repository errors are properly mapped to HTTP status codes
**Testing Focus**: Error scenario testing

## Low Risks

### 6. PERF-001: No Performance Monitoring

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - No performance requirements specified
**Impact**: Medium - Potential performance issues in production
**Mitigation**:
- Add performance monitoring to API endpoints
- Implement database query optimization
- Add response time logging
**Testing Focus**: Performance testing with load scenarios

### 7. MNT-001: Technical Debt in Mock Implementation

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: High - Mock user ID throughout codebase
**Impact**: Low - Development complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Remove all mock implementations
- Implement proper authentication flow
- Update all tests to use real auth context
**Testing Focus**: Authentication integration testing

### 8. DOC-001: Missing API Documentation

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Postman collection exists but incomplete
**Impact**: Low - Developer experience
**Mitigation**:
- Complete API documentation with examples
- Add OpenAPI specification
- Document error response formats
**Testing Focus**: Documentation review

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 3 risks (1 critical, 2 high)
- Performance: 1 risk (1 low)
- Data: 1 risk (1 high)
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks
- Technical: 3 risks (1 medium, 2 low)

### By Component

- API Layer: 4 risks
- Repository Layer: 2 risks
- Authentication: 2 risks
- Database: 1 risk

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Authentication bypass testing
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Cross-user data access scenarios
- Firestore security rule validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Ownership validation testing
- Authorization boundary testing
- Database security rule testing
- Error handling validation

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Performance baseline testing
- Error response format testing
- API documentation validation
- Test coverage verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (SEC-001)
- All high risks (SEC-002, DATA-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Low risks with documentation

### Accepted Risks

- None - all risks should be addressed

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Authentication failure rates
- Authorization violation attempts
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates by endpoint

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Authentication system is implemented
- Firestore security rules are deployed
- Performance requirements are defined
- Production monitoring is established

---

## Proposed Enhanced System Prompt

```typescript
function buildSystemPromptV2(appStateContext?: string): string {
  const basePrompt = `You are FairForm's AI Copilot, an intelligent assistant helping self-represented litigants navigate their legal cases.

## Your Core Role
Provide procedural guidance, explain legal processes in plain language, and help users understand their options. You are an educational tool and case management assistant, NOT a lawyer.

## Critical Limitations (Always Enforce)
- You CANNOT provide legal advice, predict case outcomes, or recommend legal strategies
- You CANNOT interpret laws or tell users what will happen in their specific case
- You CANNOT replace consultation with a licensed attorney
- When asked for advice or predictions, respond: "I can't provide legal advice, but I can help you understand [process/term/option]. For advice specific to your situation, please consult an attorney."

## Priority Data Collection
Extract or ask for these in order:
1. **CASE TYPE** - eviction, small claims, family law, etc.
2. **JURISDICTION** - court location (county/state)
3. **CASE NUMBER** - most critical identifier
4. **HEARING DATE** - if available

## Conversation Flow Instructions

### When Information is Ambiguous or Unclear:
- ALWAYS ask clarifying questions instead of guessing
- Example: "I see you mentioned 'Smith.' Do you mean the eviction case #12345 or the small claims matter #67890?"
- If user mentions a date without context, ask: "Is that your hearing date, the date you received the notice, or something else?"
- Never make assumptions about missing details

### When Minimum Info is Available:
- Case type + jurisdiction + (case number OR hearing date) = ready for creation
- Explicitly offer: "I have all the information needed to create your case. Would you like me to create it now?"

### Source Citation (Required):
- When stating facts about legal processes: "According to Indiana eviction procedures..."
- When referencing user's documents: "Based on your uploaded notice dated [date]..."
- When providing deadline information: "Your notice indicates a hearing on [date]..."
- Never state facts without attribution

### After Case Creation Success:
- Celebrate: "üéâ Great! Your case has been created successfully."
- Provide link: "[View your case ‚Üí](/cases/{case_id})"
- Suggest next action: "Would you like me to help you understand the next steps, or generate your action plan?"

### After Case Creation Failure:
- Acknowledge gracefully: "I encountered an issue creating your case."
- Explain what happened (if error details available)
- Offer solutions: "Would you like to try again, or would you prefer to create it manually from the dashboard?"

### When You Cannot Help:
- Be honest about limitations: "I can't help with [specific request] because [reason]."
- Offer alternatives: "Instead, I can help you with [alternative]."
- Provide escalation path: "For assistance with this, you may want to [contact support/consult attorney/use manual forms]."

## Communication Style
- **Tone:** Empathetic, supportive, never condescending
- **Reading Level:** 8th grade (simple sentences, common words)
- **Emotion:** Acknowledge user stress: "I understand this is stressful. Let's work through this together."
- **Clarity:** Use concrete examples instead of abstract legal jargon

## Structured Output Formatting
- **Dates:** Always format as "Month DD, YYYY" (e.g., "January 15, 2025")
- **Lists:** Use numbered lists for sequential steps, bulleted for options
- **Key Information:** Bold important items like case numbers or deadlines
- **Links:** Provide clickable links for actions: "[Do this ‚Üí](/url)"

## What You CAN Do:
‚úì Explain legal terms in plain language
‚úì Describe court processes and procedures
‚úì Help users understand documents
‚úì Extract information from uploaded notices
‚úì Suggest procedural next steps (file a response, attend hearing)
‚úì Answer questions about FairForm features
‚úì Create and manage cases in the system

## What You CANNOT Do:
‚úó Provide legal advice or strategy
‚úó Predict case outcomes
‚úó Interpret specific laws for user's situation
‚úó Tell users what to say in court
‚úó Guarantee any legal result
‚úó Replace an attorney's counsel

## Quality Safeguards
- If you're uncertain about information, say so: "I'm not certain about [detail]. Let me help you find authoritative information..."
- If a question requires legal expertise, redirect: "That's a question for an attorney who can review your full situation."
- If you make a mistake, acknowledge it: "I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify..."

You are here to empower users with knowledge and tools, while respecting the boundaries of legal practice.`;

  return appStateContext ? `${basePrompt}\n\n## Current Context\n${appStateContext}` : basePrompt;
}
```

## Key Improvements Over V1

### 1. **Error Handling Clarity** ‚ú®
- **Before:** Generic "never provide legal advice"
- **After:** Specific instructions on HOW to respond when limitations are hit
- **Example:** Provides exact phrasing: "I can't provide legal advice, but I can help you understand..."

### 2. **Disambiguation Protocol** üéØ
- **Before:** No explicit instruction on handling ambiguity
- **After:** Clear protocol: "ALWAYS ask clarifying questions instead of guessing"
- **Example:** Shows exact disambiguation dialogue patterns

### 3. **Source Citation Requirements** üìù
- **Before:** No citation instructions
- **After:** Mandatory attribution for all factual claims
- **Impact:** Builds trust and enables verification (key for legal context)

### 4. **Structured Failure Responses** üõü
- **Before:** Vague handling of "cannot help" scenarios
- **After:** Three-tier fallback system (Rephrase ‚Üí Alternatives ‚Üí Escalate)
- **Research Basis:** Section 7.3 "Designing Graceful Failure"

### 5. **Output Formatting Standards** üìä
- **Before:** No formatting guidance
- **After:** Specific formats for dates, lists, links
- **Impact:** Consistent, professional outputs

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update System Prompt (Immediate - 1 hour)
1. Replace `buildSystemPrompt()` in `chat/route.ts` with V2
2. Test with existing conversation flows
3. Verify no regressions

### Phase 2: Add Citation Tracking (Story 13.31+)
When implementing structured extraction (Story 13.31):
- Return source information with extracted data
- AI includes sources in responses: "According to your uploaded eviction notice..."

### Phase 3: Enhanced Disambiguation (Story 13.29)
Smart Follow-Up Questions story should leverage new disambiguation instructions:
- AI now has explicit protocol for handling ambiguity
- Works seamlessly with quick action buttons (Story 13.28)

### Phase 4: Graceful Failure UI (Story 13.40+)
The three-tier fallback should have UI support:
- Level 1: Inline clarification
- Level 2: Quick action suggestion chips
- Level 3: "Contact Support" escalation button

## Testing Checklist

After implementing V2, test these scenarios:

- [ ] **Ambiguous Input:** "Help with my case" (should ask which case)
- [ ] **Cannot Help:** "What will the judge decide?" (should decline gracefully with alternatives)
- [ ] **Source Attribution:** "What's the eviction process?" (should cite source)
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Simulate case creation failure (should offer retry/alternatives)
- [ ] **Formatting:** Check date formats, list structures, link formatting
- [ ] **Tone:** Verify 8th-grade reading level and empathetic language

## Future Enhancements (Beyond V2)

### Dynamic Prompt Injection (Section 3.2)
Per-session customization based on:
- User's case type (inject case-type-specific guidance)
- Current case stage (inject relevant process info)
- User's jurisdiction (inject state-specific procedures)

**Example:**
```typescript
function buildDynamicContext(session: AISession): string {
  if (session.caseType === 'eviction' && session.jurisdiction?.includes('Indiana')) {
    return `\n[Indiana Eviction Context]
- Standard notice period: 10 days for rent, 30 days for no cause
- Court: Marion County Small Claims Court
- Typical timeline: 2-4 weeks from filing to hearing`;
  }
  return '';
}
```

### Few-Shot Examples (Section 3.3)
For complex outputs (Story 13.34 - Case Preview), include examples in prompt:
```
Example of case summary format:
**Case Type:** Eviction
**Jurisdiction:** Marion County, IN
**Key Dates:** 
- Notice received: January 5, 2025
- Hearing date: January 25, 2025
```

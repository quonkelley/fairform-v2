- AI feature opt-in toggle (prerequisite for Epic 12)

**Dependencies:** None (foundation feature)

**Value Proposition:** User control over app experience and preferences

**Complexity:** Low-Medium - standard CRUD operations

**Recommendation:** Must-have for Sprint 3 if Epic 12 is included (AI opt-in required)

---

### Epic 13: AI Copilot & Dynamic Intake Experience üìã
**Status:** Ready (Demo Priority)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Primary Priority)  
**PRD:** Complete (`docs/prd/epic-13-ai-copilot.md`)  
**Architecture:** Unified specification validated (`docs/epic-13-unified-architecture-specification.md`)

### Epic 12: AI Intake (Smart Intake) üìù
**Status:** Superseded by Epic 13  
**Sprint:** Deferred  
**PRD:** Complete (`docs/prd/epic-12-ai-intake.md`)  
**Tech Spike:** AI Intake Tech Spike (`docs/AI_Intake_Tech_Spike.md`)

**Proposed Scope:**
- AI-assisted case type classification
- Plain-language problem description
- Follow-up Q&A for context
- User confirmation before saving

- [ ] AI compliance review completed
- [ ] UPL (Unauthorized Practice of Law) risk assessment done
- [ ] OpenAI API access configured and tested
- [ ] Feature flag strategy confirmed
- [ ] Legal disclaimer copy approved
- [ ] Moderation layer tested and validated

**Value Proposition:** Simplifies case creation with intelligent guidance

**Complexity:** High - first AI feature, significant compliance requirements

**Recommendation:** Consider deferring to Sprint 4 to allow proper compliance review and Sprint 3 focus on lower-risk features (Epic 9, 10, 11)

---

## Epic Sequencing Principles

### 1. Complete Before Starting Next
- Finish all stories in current epic before moving to next
- "In Progress" means active development, not just started
- Don't split team across multiple epics unnecessarily

### 2. Foundation Before Features
- Infrastructure (auth, data layer, design system) before user features
- User features (journey map, glossary) before AI features
- Settings and preferences before features that require them

### 3. Risk-Based Sequencing
- **Low Risk** (UI features, forms): Can implement quickly
- **Medium Risk** (integrations, notifications): Require external dependencies
- **High Risk** (AI features, legal advice): Require compliance review and careful rollout

### 4. User Value Increments
- Each epic should deliver tangible user value
- Prioritize features that complete user journeys
- Consider feature flags for experimental features

### 5. Maintain Quality Gates
- All stories must pass QA before epic marked complete
- Test coverage targets: ‚â•80% repositories, ‚â•75% components
- Accessibility: Zero WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- TypeScript: Strict mode, zero errors

## Decision Points & Dependencies

### Current Decision: Epic 6.5 Priority
**Question:** Should Epic 6.5 be the first priority in Sprint 3?

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Epic 6.5 First:** Enables Epic 10 and Epic 12 development, completes Case Journey Map feature family
- **Epic 6.5 Later:** Delays case type classification and template system needed for other epics

**Dependencies:** Epic 6 complete (Stories 6.3 & 6.4)

**Recommendation:** Epic 6.5 should be Sprint 3's first priority because:
- Provides foundation for Epic 10 (Day-in-Court Checklist) case type templates
- Enables Epic 12 (AI Intake) case type classification
- Completes the Case Journey Map feature family
- Low risk, high value incremental enhancement

---

### Next Decision: Epic 7 Timing
**Question:** When should we implement the Inline Glossary?

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Include in Sprint 3:** After Epic 6.5 completion
- **Sprint 3.5 Mini-Sprint:** Separate 2-3 day sprint, clean boundaries
- **Defer to Sprint 4+:** Focus Sprint 3 on reminders/settings/checklist first

**Dependencies:** Epic 6.5 complete (glossary integrates with step instructions)

**Recommendation:** Make decision after Epic 6.5 completion, based on:
- Team capacity and velocity
- User feedback on Epic 6.5 (do they need glossary immediately?)
- Sprint 3 scope and priorities

---

### Upcoming Decision: Epic 12 Timing
**Question:** Should AI Intake be in Sprint 3 or deferred to Sprint 4?

**Risk Factors:**
- Complexity jump from UI features to AI features
- Compliance requirements (UPL, disclaimers, moderation)
- OpenAI API dependency and costs
- Feature flag strategy needed

**Alternative for Sprint 3:**
- Focus on Epic 9 (Reminders), Epic 10 (Checklist), Epic 11 (Settings)
- Build notification infrastructure (needed for AI features later)
- Less compliance risk, more predictable delivery

**Dependencies for Epic 12:**
- Must have Epic 11 complete (AI opt-in)
- Must complete compliance review
- Must have legal disclaimer approved

**Recommendation:** Defer Epic 12 to Sprint 4, focus Sprint 3 on lower-risk, high-value features

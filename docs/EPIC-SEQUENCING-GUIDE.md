## Pending Epic Resolution

### Epic 7: Inline Glossary ü§î
**Status:** Pending Prioritization Decision  
**Sprint:** TBD  
**PRD:** Complete (`docs/prd/epic-7-inline-glossary.md`)

**Proposed Deliverables:**
- Tooltip component for legal term definitions
- Firestore glossary collection
- Auto-linking logic for terms in step instructions
- Mobile-friendly modal fallback
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

**Value Proposition:** Clarifies legal jargon for users without leaving the page

**Decision Required:** 
- **Option 1:** Include in Sprint 2 (extends sprint by 2-3 days)
- **Option 2:** Create Sprint 2.5 mini-sprint for Epic 7 only
- **Option 3:** Defer to Sprint 3 or later

**Recommendation:** Evaluate after Stories 6.3 & 6.4 complete. Epic 7 has high user value but Epic 6 completion is priority.

**Dependencies:** Epic 6 complete (glossary integrates with step instructions)

---

### Epic 8: Case Step Details ü§î
**Status:** Needs Clarification  
**Sprint:** TBD  
**PRD:** Partial (`docs/prd/epic-8-case-step-details.md`)

**Issue:** Potential overlap with Epic 6 (Case Journey Map)
- Epic 6.3 creates step detail modal
- Epic 8 also mentions step details and actions
- Need to clarify if Epic 8 is:
  - Enhancement to Epic 6 features?
  - Maintenance/refinement work?
  - Separate functionality?

**Action Required:** Review Epic 8 PRD against Epic 6 deliverables and clarify scope

**Recommendation:** Defer until Epic 6 complete, then reassess what Epic 8 should cover

---

## Future Epics (Sprint 3+)

### Epic 9: Reminders System üìù
**Status:** Draft/Planning  
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Proposed)  
**PRD:** Mentioned in Sprint 3 backlog

**Proposed Scope:**
- Email reminders via Resend
- SMS reminders via Twilio
- Reminder scheduling based on due dates
- User notification preferences
- Reminder history/logs

**Dependencies:**
- User settings for notification preferences (Epic 11)
- Case step due dates (Epic 6)

**Value Proposition:** Helps users stay on track with court deadlines

**Complexity:** Medium - requires external API integration but lower risk than AI features

**Recommendation:** Strong candidate for Sprint 3 - high value, manageable complexity

---

### Epic 10: Day-in-Court Checklist üìã
**Status:** Ready  
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Proposed)  
**PRD:** Referenced in Sprint 3 backlog

**Proposed Scope:**
- Interactive pre-hearing checklist
- Case type specific templates (Small Claims, Eviction)
- Local storage for progress (MVP)
- Link from case dashboard

**Dependencies:** Case type classification (from Epic 6 or AI Intake)

**Value Proposition:** Prepares users for their court appearance with confidence

**Complexity:** Low - primarily frontend, localStorage persistence

**Recommendation:** Good fit for Sprint 3 - quick win, high user value

---

### Epic 11: User Settings üìã
**Status:** Ready  
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Proposed)  
**PRD:** Referenced in Sprint 3 backlog

**Proposed Scope:**
- Settings page scaffold
- Profile updates (time zone, contact preferences)
- Notification preferences
- AI feature opt-in toggle (prerequisite for Epic 12)

**Dependencies:** None (foundation feature)

**Value Proposition:** User control over app experience and preferences

**Complexity:** Low-Medium - standard CRUD operations

**Recommendation:** Must-have for Sprint 3 if Epic 12 is included (AI opt-in required)

---

### Epic 12: AI Intake (Smart Intake) üìù
**Status:** Draft with Tech Spike  
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 or 4 (Decision Required)  
**PRD:** Complete (`docs/prd/epic-12-ai-intake.md`)  
**Tech Spike:** AI Intake Tech Spike (`docs/AI_Intake_Tech_Spike.md`)

**Proposed Scope:**
- AI-assisted case type classification
- Plain-language problem description
- Follow-up Q&A for context
- User confirmation before saving
- Moderation layer for safety
- Anonymized logging for compliance

**Prerequisites (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] Epic 11 complete (AI opt-in toggle required)
- [ ] AI compliance review completed
- [ ] UPL (Unauthorized Practice of Law) risk assessment done
- [ ] OpenAI API access configured and tested
- [ ] Feature flag strategy confirmed
- [ ] Legal disclaimer copy approved
- [ ] Moderation layer tested and validated

**Value Proposition:** Simplifies case creation with intelligent guidance

**Complexity:** High - first AI feature, significant compliance requirements

**Recommendation:** Consider deferring to Sprint 4 to allow proper compliance review and Sprint 3 focus on lower-risk features (Epic 9, 10, 11)

---

## Epic Sequencing Principles

### 1. Complete Before Starting Next
- Finish all stories in current epic before moving to next
- "In Progress" means active development, not just started
- Don't split team across multiple epics unnecessarily

### 2. Foundation Before Features
- Infrastructure (auth, data layer, design system) before user features
- User features (journey map, glossary) before AI features
- Settings and preferences before features that require them

### 3. Risk-Based Sequencing
- **Low Risk** (UI features, forms): Can implement quickly
- **Medium Risk** (integrations, notifications): Require external dependencies
- **High Risk** (AI features, legal advice): Require compliance review and careful rollout

### 4. User Value Increments
- Each epic should deliver tangible user value
- Prioritize features that complete user journeys
- Consider feature flags for experimental features

### 5. Maintain Quality Gates
- All stories must pass QA before epic marked complete
- Test coverage targets: ‚â•80% repositories, ‚â•75% components
- Accessibility: Zero WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- TypeScript: Strict mode, zero errors

## Decision Points & Dependencies

### Current Decision: Epic 7 Timing
**Question:** When should we implement the Inline Glossary?

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Include in Sprint 2:** Extends sprint by 2-3 days, delays Sprint 3 start
- **Sprint 2.5 Mini-Sprint:** Separate 2-3 day sprint, clean boundaries
- **Defer to Sprint 3+:** Focus Sprint 3 on reminders/settings/checklist first

**Dependencies:** Epic 6 complete (glossary integrates with step instructions)

**Recommendation:** Make decision after Stories 6.3 & 6.4 complete, based on:
- Team capacity and velocity
- User feedback on Epic 6 (do they need glossary immediately?)
- Sprint 3 scope and priorities

---

### Upcoming Decision: Epic 12 Timing
**Question:** Should AI Intake be in Sprint 3 or deferred to Sprint 4?

**Risk Factors:**
- Complexity jump from UI features to AI features
- Compliance requirements (UPL, disclaimers, moderation)
- OpenAI API dependency and costs
- Feature flag strategy needed

**Alternative for Sprint 3:**
- Focus on Epic 9 (Reminders), Epic 10 (Checklist), Epic 11 (Settings)
- Build notification infrastructure (needed for AI features later)
- Less compliance risk, more predictable delivery

**Dependencies for Epic 12:**
- Must have Epic 11 complete (AI opt-in)
- Must complete compliance review
- Must have legal disclaimer approved

**Recommendation:** Defer Epic 12 to Sprint 4, focus Sprint 3 on lower-risk, high-value features

---

## What's Next: Completing Sprint 2

Before moving to Sprint 3, we need to complete the remaining Sprint 2 stories:

### Story 6.3: Step Detail Modal
**Status:** Ready for development  
**Estimated:** 2 days  
**Story File:** `docs/stories/6.3.step-detail-modal.md`

**What It Is:** A modal that opens when users click a step, showing detailed instructions, due dates, and estimated time to complete.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Modal component using shadcn/ui Dialog
- Hardcoded instruction templates for 5 Small Claims steps
- Focus trap and keyboard accessibility
- Mobile-responsive design

### Story 6.4: Dashboard Progress Sync
**Status:** Ready for development  
**Estimated:** 1.5 days  
**Story File:** `docs/stories/6.4.dashboard-progress-sync.md`

**What It Is:** Progress calculation and visual display on dashboard case cards so users can see completion percentage at a glance.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Progress calculation function in casesRepo
- Progress bar on CaseCard component
- Automatic updates after step completion
- ARIA-accessible progress indicators

**Total Remaining:** 3.5 days of focused development

---

## Why Complete Sprint 2 First?

### Principle: Project Integrity

We follow a "complete before starting next" principle for sprints and epics. This ensures:

1. **Quality Standards:** Each epic fully tested and QA approved
2. **User Value:** Complete user journeys, not partial features
3. **Technical Debt:** No half-finished work accumulating
4. **Team Morale:** Clear completion milestones
5. **Predictability:** Accurate velocity for future planning

### Current State:

- Sprint 2 is 50% complete (2 of 4 stories)
- Epic 6 represents our core value proposition: the "Legal GPS"
- Stories 6.3 & 6.4 complete the user experience
- All infrastructure in place, just need final UI pieces

**Completing Sprint 2 = Delivering on our core promise to users**

---

## Epic Sequencing Clarity

We've created a comprehensive **Epic Sequencing Guide** (`docs/EPIC-SEQUENCING-GUIDE.md`) that clarifies the status and sequence of all epics.

### Completed Epics (Sprint 1-2):
- Epic 1: Authentication ✅
- Epic 2: Dashboard ✅
- Epic 3: Design System ✅
- Epic 4: Database/API ✅
- Epic 5: Layout/Navigation ✅
- Epic 6: Case Journey Map 🔄 (50% done, completing now)

### Pending Decisions:
- **Epic 7: Inline Glossary** - Needs prioritization decision (after 6.3/6.4 complete)
- **Epic 8: Case Step Details** - Needs scope clarification vs. Epic 6

### Future Epics:
- Epic 9: Reminders System
- Epic 10: Day-in-Court Checklist
- Epic 11: User Settings
- Epic 12: AI Intake

**Why the sequence matters:** We want to ensure foundation features are complete before moving to higher-complexity features like AI.

---

## Sprint 3: A Collaborative Discussion

Your Sprint 3 planning proposes:
- Epic 12: AI Intake (8-9 days)
- Epic 10: Day-in-Court Checklist (2-3 days)
- Epic 11: User Settings (1.5-2 days)
- AI Tech Spike: Pre-work (1.5 days)

**Total:** ~14 days with AI as primary focus

### Our Observations:

**Strengths of This Approach:**
- Addresses exciting AI features users will love
- Strong compliance planning (moderation, disclaimers)
- Good integration thinking
- Sets up Phase 1.2 vision

**Considerations:**
1. **Complexity Jump:** Sprint 2 was UI features (low risk), AI features are high risk/complexity
2. **Prerequisites:** Some prerequisites may not be complete:
   - AI compliance review status?
   - OpenAI API configured?
   - UPL risk assessment complete?
   - Feature flag strategy documented?

3. **Epic Sequence:** Why skip Epic 9 (Reminders)?
   - Reminders = medium complexity, high user value
   - Builds notification infrastructure needed for other features
   - Lower compliance risk than AI

4. **Timeline:** 14 days is ambitious with compliance requirements

---

### Alternative Approach for Discussion:

**Proposed Sprint 3 (Revised):**
1. Epic 9: Reminders System (5-6 days)
2. Epic 10: Day-in-Court Checklist (2-3 days)
3. Epic 11: User Settings (1.5-2 days)

**Total:** 9-11 days

**Proposed Sprint 4 (AI-Ready):**
1. AI Tech Spike (1.5 days)
2. Epic 12: AI Intake (8-9 days)

**Total:** 10-11 days

**Rationale:**
- Lower risk profile for Sprint 3
- Builds notification infrastructure (Epic 9)
- Creates AI opt-in toggle (Epic 11) before AI features
- Allows time for proper AI compliance review
- Still delivers AI features, just in Sprint 4 instead of 3

**Benefits:**
- More predictable delivery
- Proper foundation for AI features
- Less compliance pressure
- Maintains quality standards

## Request for Collaboration

### Immediate Priority: Complete Sprint 2

**We'd love your help with Stories 6.3 & 6.4!**

**Story Files Created:**
- `docs/stories/6.3.step-detail-modal.md` - Full requirements, technical guidance, test strategy
- `docs/stories/6.4.dashboard-progress-sync.md` - Complete implementation plan

**What We Need:**
1. Review story files for completeness/clarity
2. Implement Stories 6.3 & 6.4 (3.5 days estimated)
3. Follow established patterns from Stories 6.1 & 6.2
4. Maintain test coverage and accessibility standards

**Timeline:** This week (next 3.5 days)

---

### Epic 7 Decision Point

After Stories 6.3 & 6.4 complete, we need to decide on **Epic 7 (Inline Glossary)** timing:

**Options:**
1. Include in Sprint 2 (extends by 2-3 days)
2. Create Sprint 2.5 mini-sprint
3. Defer to Sprint 3 or later

**Decision Criteria:**
- Team velocity on 6.3/6.4
- User feedback on Epic 6
- Sprint 3 priorities

**Your Input Valued:** What do you think about glossary timing?

---

### Sprint 3 Scope Discussion

We want to **collaborate on Sprint 3 scope** rather than dictate it.

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. **AI Timing:** Do you see value in deferring Epic 12 to Sprint 4 to allow proper compliance review? Or do you think we can handle compliance in parallel?

2. **Epic 9 Priority:** Would starting with Reminders (Epic 9) provide good infrastructure for later features? Or is there a reason to prioritize AI first?

3. **Prerequisites:** What AI prerequisites are already complete? What's still needed?

4. **Complexity Management:** How do you feel about the complexity jump from UI to AI features?

5. **Team Capacity:** Is the 14-day Sprint 3 estimate realistic with compliance requirements?

**Let's discuss and find the best path forward together.**

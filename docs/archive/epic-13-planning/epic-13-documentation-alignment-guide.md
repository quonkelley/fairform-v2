---

## Compliance Framework Alignment

All documents agree on these compliance requirements:

### Core Principles

1. **Educational Guidance Only**
   - No legal advice
   - No case outcome predictions
   - No strategic recommendations
   - Clear boundaries in system prompts

2. **Data Protection**
   - No PII sent outside Firestore
   - Anonymization for analytics
   - Secure context handling
   - Audit logging enabled

3. **Responsible AI Safeguards**

| Safeguard | Implementation | Document Reference |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Legal Disclaimer | Auto-injected at chat start | Epic 13 Â§5, Leadership Memo Â§4 |
| Content Filter | Pre/post moderation wrapper | Epic 13 PRD |
| Session Logging | Full conversation audit trail | All documents |
| Demo Sandbox | Isolated test environment | Leadership Memo Â§3 |

### Disclaimers

**Standard Disclaimer (appears at chat start):**
> "This AI assistant provides educational information about legal processes. It does not provide legal advice and cannot predict case outcomes. Always consult with a qualified attorney for advice specific to your situation."

---

## Success Metrics Alignment

### Demo Readiness Criteria (from Leadership Memo)

- âœ… Conversational case creation (no forms)
- âœ… Context-aware chat memory across sessions
- âœ… Accessible anywhere in app (floating widget)
- âœ… No login or form gates
- âœ… Zero flagged compliance issues

### Performance Targets (from Epic 13 PRD)

| Metric | Target | Test Method |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Chat latency | â‰¤ 3s round trip | Load testing |
| Context accuracy | 90%+ correct references | Manual QA validation |
| Compliance | Zero flagged outputs | Moderation review |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime | Monitoring |

---

## Decision Points for Leadership

These questions appear across documents and require leadership input:

### 1. Demo Scope
**Question:** Should the demo Copilot connect to live Firestore data or a sandbox dataset?
**Context:** Sandbox provides safety; live data shows real capabilities
**Recommendation:** Start with sandbox, enable live data toggle for advanced demos

### 2. Form Integration
**Question:** Can AI reference real court forms (e.g., SC-100)?
**Context:** Real forms increase utility but require compliance validation
**Recommendation:** Phase 1 uses placeholder templates; Phase 2 adds real forms post-legal review

### 3. Disclaimer Strategy
**Question:** Persistent (every message) or contextual (on risky responses)?
**Context:** Balance between safety and user experience
**Recommendation:** Persistent header + contextual warnings for sensitive topics

### 4. Telemetry
**Question:** Should AI chat analytics be logged during demos?
**Context:** Useful for optimization but may expose sensitive data
**Recommendation:** Anonymized logging enabled; full audit mode for internal testing only

### 5. Access Control
**Question:** Public vs internal testing - is Copilot ready for external users?
**Context:** Demo-ready â‰  production-ready
**Recommendation:** Internal demo only for October; external beta in Phase 1.4

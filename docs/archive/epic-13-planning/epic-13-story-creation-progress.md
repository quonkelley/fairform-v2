## 🏗️ Architecture Context

**Epic 13 transforms FairForm's AI intake into a persistent, context-aware conversational system** - the AI Copilot. This architecture has been validated by multiple teams and approved for implementation.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- ✅ Maintains FairForm's repository pattern
- ✅ Uses subcollection pattern for message storage
- ✅ Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses
- ✅ Separate Firebase project for demo isolation
- ✅ Context snapshots with fingerprinting for performance
- ✅ Comprehensive security and compliance framework

**Source Documents:**
- **PRD:** `docs/prd/epic-13-ai-copilot.md`
- **Architecture:** `docs/epic-13-unified-architecture-specification.md`
- **Config:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`

---

## 📁 Story File Locations

All stories are located in: `docs/stories/`

**File Naming Pattern:** `13.{number}.{story-title-short}.md`

**Examples:**
- `docs/stories/13.1.ai-sessions-repository.md`
- `docs/stories/13.2.chat-api-sse-streaming.md`
- `docs/stories/13.3.context-builder-fingerprinting.md`
- etc.

## 🎯 Next Steps for Scrum Master

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Continue creating remaining stories** (13.14 - 13.20)
2. **Follow established story template** from `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`
3. **Reference architecture specification** for technical details
4. **Maintain consistency** with existing story structure

**Story Creation Process:**
1. Read the architecture specification for technical context
2. Create story following the template structure
3. Include comprehensive Dev Notes with architecture references
4. Add detailed Tasks/Subtasks with acceptance criteria mapping
5. Include testing requirements and source tree information

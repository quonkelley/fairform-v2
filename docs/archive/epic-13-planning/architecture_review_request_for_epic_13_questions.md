## Original Review Request (For Historical Reference)

  Task: Review the technical architecture for Epic
   13 and validate the design before story
  creation.

  Context Documents:
  - Epic 13 PRD: /docs/prd/epic-13-ai-copilot.md
  - Alignment Guide:
  /docs/epic-13-documentation-alignment-guide.md
  - Leadership Memo: /docs/leadership_decision_mem
  o_ai_gating_removal_and_copilot_launch.md

  Key Areas for Review:

  1. Architecture Validation

  Review the proposed architecture in Epic 13:
  User Interface Layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ <AICopilotChat /> (React component)
  â””â”€â”€ Floating chat bubble (persistent across app)
             â†“
  Middleware Layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/ai/contextBroker.ts (context
  aggregation)
  â”œâ”€â”€ lib/ai/contextBuilder.ts (data preparation)
  â””â”€â”€ lib/ai/promptTemplates.ts (system prompts)
             â†“
  Data Layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ Firestore (cases, caseSteps, users)
  â”œâ”€â”€ aiSessions collection (conversation history)
  â””â”€â”€ React Query (caching & sync)
             â†“
  AI Layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ OpenAI API (GPT-5)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Content moderation endpoints
  â””â”€â”€ Safety filters & logging

  Questions:
  - Does this align with FairForm's repository
  pattern?
  - Are there any architectural gaps or risks?
  - How should we handle the new aiSessions
  collection?

  2. Data Model Design

  The PRD mentions:
  - New Firestore collection:
  aiSessions/{sessionId}
  - Context injection from existing collections
  (cases, caseSteps, users)
  - Conversation persistence

  Questions:
  - What should the aiSessions schema look like?
  - How do we handle session lifecycle (creation,
  expiration, cleanup)?
  - What's the relationship between sessions and
  cases?

  3. Security & Compliance

  - Context broker will aggregate sensitive case
  data
  - AI responses need content moderation
  - Demo mode needs data isolation
  - PII handling for AI prompts

  Questions:
  - How do we secure the context broker API?
  - What Firestore security rules are needed for
  aiSessions?
  - How do we implement demo sandbox mode safely?

  4. Integration with Existing Systems

  Epic 13 needs to integrate with:
  - Auth context
  (components/auth/auth-context.tsx)
  - Case repositories (lib/db/casesRepo.ts)
  - Journey templates (lib/journeys/templates/)
  - Glossary system (Epic 7)

  Questions:
  - How should the copilot hook into existing
  React Query patterns?
  - Should we extend existing repos or create new
  ones?
  - How do we handle real-time context updates?

  5. Performance & Scalability

  - Chat latency target: â‰¤ 3s round trip
  - Context-heavy prompts may hit token limits
  - Conversation history grows over time

  Questions:
  - How do we optimize context size for AI
  prompts?
  - What caching strategy should we use?
  - How do we handle conversation history
  pagination?

  6. Technology Selection

  PRD mentions:
  - OpenAI API (GPT-5)
  - React Query for state management
  - Firestore for persistence

  Questions:
  - Do we need any additional libraries (WebSocket
   for real-time, etc.)?
  - How do we handle OpenAI API errors and
  retries?
  - Should we consider streaming responses?

  types)
  4. Security recommendations and Firestore rules
  5. Integration patterns with existing codebase
  6. Any architectural risks and mitigation
  strategies

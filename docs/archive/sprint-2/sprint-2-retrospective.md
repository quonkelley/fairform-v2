## 🎉 What Went Well

### Technical Excellence
- **Test Coverage:** Achieved excellent test coverage across all layers (unit, component, integration)
- **Code Quality:** Both stories received perfect quality scores (100/100) with zero technical debt
- **Accessibility:** Zero violations across all components using shadcn/ui primitives
- **Repository Pattern:** Maintained clean separation of concerns throughout

### Process & Tooling
- **BMAD Integration:** Agent-based workflow (Dev, QA, PO, SM) worked seamlessly
- **Quality Gates:** QA gate process provided clear PASS/FAIL criteria with detailed traceability
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Caught issues early and maintained type safety
- **Vitest + RTL:** Fast test execution with clear failure messages

### User Experience
- **Plain Language:** Step instructions at 8th grade reading level achieved (Story 6.3)
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach worked well for all components
- **Progress Visibility:** Users can now see their case progress at a glance (Story 6.4)
- **Graceful Degradation:** Handled legacy cases and missing data elegantly

### Design System
- **shadcn/ui Components:** Dialog and Progress components provided excellent accessibility out of the box
- **Consistent Patterns:** Reusable components followed established patterns
- **ARIA Support:** Proper ARIA attributes from the start

## 🔧 What Could Be Improved

### Pre-Existing Issues
- **AI Intake Files:** TypeScript errors existed in unrelated AI files (lib/ai/schemas.ts, tests/api/ai-intake.test.ts)
  - **Action:** Fixed during sprint, but should have been caught earlier
  - **Prevention:** Run type-check before starting each sprint

### Documentation
- **Architecture Loading:** Had to manually check architecture files during QA review
  - **Improvement:** Create quick reference guide for common architecture lookups
  
### Story Preparation
- **Dev Notes Completeness:** Stories had excellent Dev Notes, but could streamline architecture references
  - **Improvement:** Consider architecture "cheat sheets" per epic

## 🚀 Action Items for Sprint 3

### Process Improvements
1. ✅ **Pre-Sprint Type Check:** Run `npm run type-check` before sprint kickoff
2. 📝 **Architecture Quick Reference:** Create condensed reference for common patterns
3. 📋 **Story Template:** Enhance story template with architecture reference checklist

### Technical Improvements  
1. 🔄 **Background Jobs:** Consider background job to calculate progress for existing legacy cases (Story 6.4 recommendation)
2. 📚 **Firestore Instructions:** Plan migration from hardcoded to Firestore-backed step instructions (Phase 1.5)

### Quality Process
1. ✅ **Maintain Standards:** Continue zero-violation accessibility policy
2. ✅ **Test Architecture:** Continue excellent test distribution across layers
3. ✅ **Quality Gates:** QA gate process working perfectly, continue using

## 🎯 Sprint 3 Readiness

**Ready to Start:** ✅ YES

**Team Confidence:** HIGH

**Blockers:** None

**Next Epic:** Epic 11 (User Settings) → Epic 12 (AI Intake) → Epic 10 (Checklist)

**Estimated Velocity:** Based on Sprint 2 performance, team can handle Epic 11 (1.5 days) + Epic 12 (5.5 days) comfortably in a 2-week sprint.

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Agent-Based Workflow Works:** The BMAD agent system (Dev/QA/PO/SM) provides clear role separation and high-quality output
2. **Quality Gates Are Valuable:** Having formal PASS/FAIL gates prevents technical debt accumulation
3. **shadcn/ui Is a Winner:** Pre-built accessible components significantly speed up development
4. **Test-First Approach Pays Off:** Writing tests alongside implementation caught issues early
5. **Repository Pattern Scales:** Clean separation between UI and data layers makes testing easier

---

## 🙏 Shout-Outs

- **Dev Agent (James):** Excellent implementation quality, comprehensive tests, clear documentation
- **QA Agent (Quinn):** Thorough reviews with actionable feedback, zero unnecessary blocking
- **BMAD System:** Smooth context switching between agent roles

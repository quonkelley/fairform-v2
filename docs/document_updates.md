\- Updated epic sequence and dependencies  
\- Clear demo readiness criteria and timeline

\#\#\# 3\. \*\*Updated Epic Sequencing Guide\*\* (\`docs/EPIC-SEQUENCING-GUIDE.md\`)  
\- Epic 6 marked as complete  
\- Epic 6.5 marked as in progress

\#\# ðŸŽ¯ Key Strategic Decisions Documented

\#\#\# \*\*Foundation-First Approach Validated\*\*  
\- Epic 6.5 provides case type system that Epic 13 needs  
\- ContextSnapshot requires \`caseType\` field from Epic 6.5  
\- Proper sequencing reduces implementation risk

\#\#\# \*\*Demo Timeline Established\*\*  
\- \*\*3 weeks\*\* for AI Copilot demo readiness  
\- Epic 6.5 completion first, then Epic 13 implementation  
\- Clear demo criteria and stakeholder impact

\#\#\# \*\*Work Sequencing Rationale\*\*  
\- Epic 6.5 â†’ Epic 13 â†’ Supporting features (Epic 10/11)  
\- Parallel work opportunities identified  
\- Risk mitigation strategies documented

\#\# ðŸ“‹ Ready for Next Chat Session

The context is now properly documented and ready to pass to your next chat session. The \*\*\`docs/CURRENT-SPRINT-CONTEXT.md\`\*\* document provides everything needed to continue work seamlessly.

\*\*Recommendation:\*\* Complete Epic 6.5 first (you're already in progress), then proceed to Epic 13 for the demo-ready AI Copilot. This provides the strongest foundation and reduces implementation risk.

All documentation is now aligned and provides a clear path from your current state to an impressive AI-powered demo\! ðŸš€

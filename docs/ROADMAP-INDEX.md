## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Value-First Approach
Focus on features that demonstrate user value and impress investors during demos. Defer infrastructure/security features to post-demo implementation.

### Three-Phase Strategy (Epic 13)
1. **PHASE 1:** Case Creation - The "wow" factor
2. **PHASE 2:** Enhanced Experience - Premium feel
3. **PHASE 3:** Demo Polish - Quality signal

### "Act" Phase Addition
Epic 18 adds the missing "Act" phase between "Remind" and "Show Up Confident", enabling users to generate actual court documents.

### Demo-Ready vs Production-Ready
- **Demo:** Focus on functionality, polished UX, demo scenarios
- **Production:** Add Epic 14 (security, compliance, legal protection)

# Epic 3: Design System Foundations

## Summary

Stand up the shared design system for FairForm using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui so features ship quickly with consistent, accessible UI.

## Business Value

- Ensures cohesive visual language across MVP features.
- Speeds development through reusable components.
- Establishes accessibility and theming standards from day one.

## Scope

**In Scope**

- Tailwind configuration with FairForm color palette and typography scale.
- shadcn/ui installation and integration into the component library.
- Reusable Button, Card, FormField, and typography primitives.
- Accessibility audit for keyboard navigation, focus states, and color contrast.

**Out of Scope**

- Full component library coverage beyond MVP needs.
- Theming for dark mode or jurisdiction-specific branding.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tailwind config exposes tokens for brand colors, typography, spacing, and shadows.
2. shadcn/ui is installed with tree-shakable exports configured.
3. Button component supports primary, secondary/ghost, disabled, and loading states with keyboard/focus styling.
4. Card and FormField abstractions are available for dashboard and auth flows.
5. Global typography scale is documented and applied to page templates.
6. Automated and manual accessibility checks confirm WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for base components.

## Dependencies

- Design specification (`docs/ðŸŽ¨ FairForm â€“ Design Specification.md`).
- Accessibility guardrails in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.
- Build tooling defined in `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`.

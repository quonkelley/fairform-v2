# Epic 17: Enhanced Hearing Day Experience

## üß≠ Overview

- **Status:** Planned ‚Äì Phase 5 ("Show up ready")
- **Priority:** P1 (final confidence crescendo before form filler)
- **Timebox:** 1 short sprint (can overlap with Epic 18 ramp-up)
- **Dependencies:** Epic 6.5 (case journey system), Epic 16 (deadline engine), Epic 9 (reminders)

## üéØ Purpose

Deliver an enhanced experience for hearing day preparation by making hearing steps in the case journey special. When users open a hearing step, they get an immersive, confidence-building modal with interactive checklists, day-of guidance, and all the resources they need to show up prepared.

### Success Definition

- User clicks on a hearing step in their case journey
- An enhanced modal opens (larger than normal steps) with:
  - Interactive preparation checklist
  - Day-of timeline and courtroom guidance
  - Quick access to completed documents
  - Court location/details
  - Confidence-building tips
- Completing checklist items provides immediate feedback
- Marking step complete triggers special celebration
- All state persists in Firestore

## üí° Roadmap Alignment

| Roadmap Phase | Contribution |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| **Phase 5 ‚Äì Hearing Day Mode** | Implements "Court-day confidence" moment (`docs/FAIRFORM_VALUE_FIRST_DEMO_ROADMAP.md:90`). |
| **Epic 6.5 outputs** | Leverages case journey system and step modal infrastructure. |
| **Phase 3 & 4 outputs** | Consumes deadline engine + reminder data to highlight urgent tasks. |
| **Phase 6 (Epic 18)** | Surfaces completed forms generated in Smart Form Filler. |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guardrails

- **Step Type Integration:** Add new `hearing` step type to existing StepType enum
- **Modal Enhancement:** Create `HearingStepModal` component that extends/replaces standard `StepDetailModal` for hearing steps
- **Component Location:** New components under `components/case-journey/hearing/`
- **Data Source:** Hearing prep data in journey templates (`hearingPrep` metadata), persisted checklist state in Firestore
- **Repository Pattern:** Use `stepsRepo` and `casesRepo` for all data operations
- **Accessibility:** Enhanced modal maintains focus trap, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, reduced-motion fallback

### Out of Scope
- Scheduling hearings or calendar integration
- Court calendar sync
- User-generated checklist items

- Real-time updates from court systems

## üì¶ Deliverables

1. **Step Type Addition:** Add `hearing` to StepTypeSchema in `lib/validation.ts`

3. **Checklist Component:** `HearingChecklist` with interactive items and persistence
4. **Journey Template Data:** Extend small claims and eviction templates with `hearingPrep` metadata
5. **Visual Enhancements:** Special styling/icon for hearing steps in step-node.tsx
6. **Firestore Schema:** Add `hearingChecklist` field to case steps document structure
7. **Repository Methods:** Add methods to stepsRepo for checklist state management
8. **QA Materials:** Playwright tests for hearing step flow; accessibility audit

## üìö Stories

### Story 17.1 ‚Äì Hearing Step Type & Data Model

**Objective:** Add `hearing` step type and define hearing prep data structure

**Tasks:**
- Add `hearing` to StepTypeSchema in lib/validation.ts

### Story 17.2 ‚Äì Enhanced Hearing Step Modal UI

**Objective:** Build special modal experience for hearing steps

**Tasks:**
- Create `HearingStepModal` component extending Dialog from shadcn/ui
- Design layout with sections: Overview, Checklist, Timeline, Court Details, Documents, Tips
- Implement responsive design (mobile-friendly, desktop enhanced)
- Add special header with hearing date countdown
- Implement keyboard navigation and focus management
- Add reduced-motion fallbacks for animations

**Tasks:**
- Add methods to stepsRepo: `updateHearingChecklist(stepId, checklist)`
- Create React hook: `useHearingChecklist(stepId)` for state management
- Implement optimistic updates for checkbox toggles
- Integrate reminder status (show "Reminder sent" badge if applicable)
- Wire up document section to query completed forms for case
- Add special completion celebration (confetti + message)
- Handle error states gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Checking/unchecking checklist items persists to Firestore
- State updates in real-time across sessions
- Reminder badges show correctly when applicable
- Documents section shows all completed forms with download links
- Celebration triggers when step marked complete
- Error messages display for failed operations

## üìä Metrics

- Modal open animation completes within <200ms
- Checklist toggle responds within <100ms (optimistic update)
- Accessibility audit: 0 violations
- User completion rate: Track % of users who complete hearing checklist
- Time to prepare: Average time users spend in hearing modal
- Step completion: Track hearing step completion rates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Modal feels too different from other steps | Maintain consistent header/footer patterns; only enhance content area. |
| Checklist items too generic | Work with legal advisor to create case-type-specific checklists. |
| State sync issues with checklist | Use optimistic updates + error recovery; add retry logic. |
| Performance with large checklists | Virtualize checklist if >20 items; use React.memo for item components. |
| Users miss the hearing step | Add visual prominence + optional notification when hearing approaches. |

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

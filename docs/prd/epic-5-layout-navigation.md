## Business Value

- Delivers a cohesive experience across dashboard, settings, and future case views.
- Reinforces brand credibility and usability.
- Provides navigation patterns reused by subsequent features.

## Scope

**In Scope**

- Multi-tenant navigation or role-based menus.
- Localization or multi-language navigation labels.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Navigation displays Dashboard, Settings, and Logout actions with clear labels.
3. Active route is visually indicated and conveyed to screen readers.
4. Layout adapts to mobile and desktop breakpoints with no horizontal scroll.
5. Keyboard users can cycle through navigation and action elements in logical order.

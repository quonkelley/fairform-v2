# Epic 14: Security & Compliance

## üîí Overview

**Status:** DEFERRED - Implement post-demo, pre-production  
**Priority:** P1 (Critical for production launch)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Epic 13 must be complete and demo-tested

## üéØ Purpose

This epic contains all security, compliance, and legal protection features required for production launch but not needed for demo/investor presentations. These stories were strategically moved from Epic 13 to maintain focus on value and functionality for demos.

## üö´ Why Deferred?

**Strategic Decision (PM/PO):**
- Security features don't demonstrate user value to investors
- Compliance is "table stakes" - assumed but not impressive
- Demo needs to showcase functionality and AI capabilities
- These are critical for production but invisible in demos

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **Now:** Focus on Epic 13 value features
- **After:** Secure investment/approval
- **Before:** Public production launch

## üìã Stories

### 14.1: Firestore Security Rules (was 13.14)
**Original Story:** `docs/stories/13.14.firestore-security-rules.md`

**Purpose:** Implement comprehensive Firestore security rules for user data isolation

**Priority:** P0 (Must have for production)

**Key Requirements:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Data isolation per user
- Read/write permissions
- Admin access controls
- Demo environment exceptions

**Why Deferred:** Backend security not visible in demos

---

### 14.2: Content Moderation Enhancement (was 13.15)
**Original Story:** `docs/stories/13.15.content-moderation-enhancement.md`

**Purpose:** Enhance content moderation beyond basic OpenAI flagging

**Priority:** P1 (Important for production)

**Key Requirements:**
- Multi-layer moderation
- Custom keyword filtering
- Escalation workflows
- Audit logging
- User reporting

**Why Deferred:** Safety features operate behind the scenes

---

### 14.3: Disclaimer System (was 13.16)
**Original Story:** `docs/stories/13.16.disclaimer-system.md`

**Purpose:** Legal protection and user awareness system

**Priority:** P1 (Required for legal protection)

**Key Requirements:**
- Legal disclaimers and disclosures
- Terms acceptance tracking
- Attorney advertising notices
- State-specific requirements
- Acknowledgment logging

**Why Deferred:** Legal boilerplate doesn't impress investors

---

### 14.4: PII Redaction (was 13.17)
**Original Story:** `docs/stories/13.17.pii-redaction.md`

**Purpose:** Automatic detection and redaction of personally identifiable information

**Priority:** P1 (Privacy compliance)

**Key Requirements:**
- PII pattern detection
- Automatic redaction
- Admin override capabilities
- Audit trails
- Privacy compliance

**Why Deferred:** Privacy features work invisibly

## üéØ Implementation Trigger

**When to Start Epic 14:**
1. ‚úÖ Epic 13 demo successfully delivered
2. ‚úÖ Investor presentation complete or funding secured
3. ‚úÖ Decision made to move to production
4. ‚è±Ô∏è Minimum 2-3 weeks before public launch

**Blocking Criteria:**
- Cannot launch to public without Epic 14 complete
- Demo environment can operate without these features
- Internal testing can proceed without full compliance

## üìä Success Metrics

**Security:**
- 100% of data properly isolated by user
- Zero unauthorized data access
- All PII automatically detected and redacted

**Compliance:**
- Legal disclaimers presented and acknowledged
- Complete audit trails for all sensitive operations
- State-specific requirements met

**Production Readiness:**
- Security audit passed
- Privacy impact assessment complete
- Legal review approved

## üîó Dependencies

**Required from Epic 13:**
- Story 13.1: AI Sessions Repository (data structure)
- Story 13.2: Chat API (endpoints to protect)
- Story 13.7: useAICopilot Hook (user context)

**Blocks Production Launch:**
- Without 14.1: Data security risk
- Without 14.2: Content liability risk
- Without 14.3: Legal liability risk
- Without 14.4: Privacy compliance risk

## üìù Notes

**Demo Environment:**
- Can operate with relaxed security rules
- Content moderation uses basic OpenAI flagging
- Disclaimers not required for demo
- PII redaction not necessary for test data

**Production Environment:**
- Must implement all Epic 14 stories
- No exceptions for security/compliance
- Full audit trails required
- Legal review mandatory

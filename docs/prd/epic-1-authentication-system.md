# Epic 1: Authentication System

## Summary

Deliver secure account creation, login, and session management so self-represented litigants can access personalized case data with confidence.

## Business Value

- Establishes trust through secure onboarding.
- Enables persistent sessions required for dashboard and case management.
- Provides the foundation for future personalization and notifications.

## Scope

**In Scope**

- Firebase project configuration and environment variables.
- Email/password sign-up, login, logout, and password reset flows.
- Protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users.
- Accessibility-compliant authentication interfaces with feedback.

**Out of Scope**

- Social sign-in providers.
- Multi-factor authentication.
- Admin account management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can create an account with email and password; validation errors are shown inline.
2. Users can log in and log out; session persists across browser refresh.
3. Users can request password reset via email.
4. Unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes are redirected to the login page.
5. Toast notifications or inline status messages communicate success and failure states.
6. Authentication screens meet WCAG 2.1 AA (focus order, labels, contrast).

## Dependencies

- Firebase Auth keys stored via Vercel environment variables.
- shadcn/ui components for form controls.

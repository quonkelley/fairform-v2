**Status:** COMPLETE & APPROVED
**Completed:** 2025-10-10
**All Acceptance Criteria:** MET

### Deliverables Completed
- ✅ `lib/hooks/useCompleteStep.ts` - React Query mutation hook (73 lines, NEW)
- ✅ Updated `components/case-journey/step-node.tsx` - Added "Mark Complete" button
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error

---------------------------------------------------
Total: 51/51 tests passed (100%)
Type Check: PASS
Lint: PASS
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Mark Complete Button** - Appears on incomplete steps only
2. **Optimistic Updates** - UI updates immediately before server response
3. **Error Handling** - User-friendly messages with automatic rollback
4. **Loading States** - Button shows "Completing..." during mutation
5. **Query Invalidation** - Timeline automatically refetches after completion
6. **Persistence** - Completion state syncs to Firestore with `completedAt` timestamp

### Technical Implementation
- **Mutation Pattern**: React Query `useMutation` with `onMutate`, `onError`, `onSuccess` callbacks
- **API Integration**: PATCH `/api/steps/[id]/complete` endpoint
- **Cache Management**: Optimistic update with snapshot for rollback
- **Authorization**: API validates user owns case before allowing updates

## Remaining Work (Week 2)

### Story 6.3: Step Detail Modal (Ready for Development)
**Priority:** Must-Have
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Dependencies:** Story 6.1 ✅ Complete
**Story File:** `docs/stories/6.3.step-detail-modal.md` ✅ Created

**Planned Deliverables:**
- `components/case-journey/step-detail-modal.tsx` - Modal component
- `lib/data/step-instructions.ts` - Hardcoded instruction templates
- Updated `components/case-journey/step-node.tsx` - Click handler
- Comprehensive test suite (component, accessibility, keyboard nav)

**Key Features:**
- shadcn/ui Dialog component integration
- Hardcoded templates for 5 Small Claims steps
- Focus trap and keyboard accessibility (ESC to close)
- Mobile-responsive design (full-width on mobile)
- Due date display with calendar icon

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Clicking a step opens detail modal with instructions
2. Modal displays step name, instructions, and due date
3. Modal is dismissible (X button, ESC, click outside)
4. Keyboard accessible (Tab to navigate, ESC to close)
5. Screen reader announces modal open/close
6. Mobile-friendly modal design

**Technical Approach:**
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog (already installed)
- Hardcoded instruction templates for MVP
- Focus management via Dialog built-in behavior
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Responsive breakpoints (full-width mobile, max-width 600px desktop)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Component tests (modal open/close, content display)
- Accessibility tests (jest-axe, keyboard navigation)
- Integration tests (click step → modal opens)
- Responsive tests (mobile/tablet/desktop)

---

### Story 6.4: Dashboard Progress Sync (Ready for Development)
**Priority:** Should-Have
**Estimated Effort:** 1.5 days
**Dependencies:** Story 6.2 ✅ Complete
**Story File:** `docs/stories/6.4.dashboard-progress-sync.md` ✅ Created

**Planned Deliverables:**
- `calculateCaseProgress()` function in `lib/db/casesRepo.ts`
- Updated `components/dashboard/case-card.tsx` with progress bar
- Progress calculation on step completion (server-side)
- React Query cache invalidation for dashboard updates

**Key Features:**
- Progress fields added to Case interface (`progressPct`, `totalSteps`, `completedSteps`)
- Calculation: `(completedSteps / totalSteps) * 100`
- shadcn/ui Progress component for visual display
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Automatic updates within 1s of step completion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Dashboard case cards show progress percentage (0-100%)
2. Progress bar provides visual indicator
3. Progress updates within 1s of step completion
4. Progress calculation accurate: `(completed / total) * 100`
5. Empty state handling (0% shows gracefully)
6. Accessible progress bar with `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`

**Technical Approach:**
- Add optional progress fields to Case schema (backward compatible)
- Server-side calculation during step completion (no extra API call)
- React Query invalidates cases query for dashboard refetch
- Handle legacy cases gracefully (missing progress data)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests (progress calculation edge cases: 0%, partial, 100%, no steps)
- Component tests (progress bar display, ARIA attributes)
- Integration tests (complete step → dashboard updates)
- Accessibility tests (jest-axe, screen reader compatibility)

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Data Flow
```
UI Component (CaseJourneyMap)
  → React Hook (useCaseSteps)
    → API Route (/api/cases/[id]/steps)
      → Repository (stepsRepo.listByCase)
        → Firestore (caseSteps collection)
```

### Component Hierarchy
```
CaseDetailPage (/cases/[id])
├─ ProtectedRoute (authentication wrapper)
├─ Breadcrumb Navigation (Dashboard > Case Details)
├─ CaseJourneyMap (Story 6.1)
│  ├─ StepNode[] (Story 6.1 + 6.2)
│  │  ├─ StepIcon (CheckCircle2/Clock/Circle)
│  │  ├─ StepContent (name, order, status badge)
│  │  └─ CompleteButton (Story 6.2)
│  │     └─ useCompleteStep mutation hook
```

### State Management
**React Query Keys:**
- `['caseSteps', caseId]` - Steps for a case
- `['cases', userId]` - User's cases (from Epic 4)

**Mutations:**
- `useMutation(['completeStep', stepId])` - Story 6.2

**ARIA Implementation:**
- Descriptive labels with status: "Step 1 of 5: File Complaint - Completed"
- Decorative icons marked `aria-hidden="true"`
- Error messages with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- All step nodes focusable with `tabIndex={0}`
- Enter/Space key handlers implemented
- Visible focus indicators via design system

**Color Contrast:**
- All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Success green, primary blue, muted gray all compliant

## 📋 Risk Management & Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Our Approach

**1. Timeline Pressure (Medium Risk)**
- **Risk**: 3 weeks is aggressive for AI integration
- **Mitigation**:
  - All 20 stories fully specified with detailed technical notes
  - Architecture validated by multiple teams
  - Clear dependencies and integration points documented
  - Focus on core demo functionality first, polish second

**2. Compliance & Legal Review (Medium Risk)**
- **Risk**: AI features may raise legal practice concerns
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive disclaimer system (Story 13.16)
  - Clear "educational guidance, not legal advice" positioning
  - Content moderation for inappropriate responses
  - PII redaction for privacy protection
  - Demo sandbox isolation from production

**3. Technical Complexity (Low Risk)**
- **Risk**: AI features more complex than anticipated
- **Mitigation**:
  - Validated architecture specification
  - OpenAI API proven in production
  - Story 13.1 (foundation) already validated
  - Incremental implementation approach

**4. Epic 6.5 Dependency (Low Risk)**
- **Risk**: Delay in Epic 6.5 pushes back Epic 13 start
- **Mitigation**:
  - Only 2-3 days remaining on Epic 6.5
  - Clear scope definition (4 stories only)
  - Can begin Epic 13 setup in parallel if needed

# Story 3.1: Design System Foundations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** front-end developer,  
**I want** a shared design system with reusable components and accessibility baked in,  
**so that** I can build FairForm features quickly and consistently without reimplementing UI primitives.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tailwind config exports FairForm brand tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows as defined in the design spec.  
2. `shadcn/ui` is installed and configured with tree-shakable exports, ready for component generation.  
3. `Button` component covers primary, ghost/secondary, disabled, loading states with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard focus indicators.  
4. `Card` and `FormField` components exist and are reusable for authentication and dashboard flows.  
5. Typography scale (headings, body, captions) is documented and applied globally (e.g., via CSS variables or Tailwind theme) to match the design specification.  
6. Automated (linting, unit) and manual accessibility checks confirm WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for the base components (focus order, contrast, keyboard navigation).  
7. Design system documentation/README describes component usage patterns and references design tokens.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Configure Tailwind theme tokens (AC: 1,5)  
  - [ ] Update `tailwind.config.ts` with color palette, typography scale, spacing, and shadows per design spec (AC: 1,5)  
  - [ ] Add global styles (e.g., `styles/globals.css`) for base typography and background/foreground tokens (AC: 5)
- [ ] Install and wire `shadcn/ui` (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Add shadcn CLI setup, generate initial component boilerplate into `components/ui` (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Verify tree-shaking in Next.js build by importing via barrel exports (AC: 2)
- [ ] Build Button component suite (AC: 3,6)  
  - [ ] Implement primary, secondary/ghost, destructive (if needed), disabled, and loading variants with consistent API (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Include keyboard focus styles, ARIA attributes, and loading spinner semantics (AC: 3,6)
- [ ] Build Card and FormField primitives (AC: 4,6)  
  - [ ] Create `Card` with header, body, footer slots for dashboard layout (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Create `FormField` wrapper integrating label, description, error message, and states for `react-hook-form` usage (AC: 4,6)
- [ ] Document typography scale and component usage (AC: 5,7)  
  - [ ] Update or create `docs/design-system.md` or README inside `components/ui` outlining tokens and usage examples (AC: 7)  
  - [ ] Ensure typography classes are applied globally and used in example components (AC: 5)
- [ ] Accessibility and testing (AC: 3,4,6)  
  - [ ] Snapshot/RTL tests for Button variants and FormField error states (AC: 3,4,6)  
  - [ ] Manual keyboard + contrast audit using tooling (e.g., axe) and document findings in Dev Notes (AC: 6)  
  - [ ] Update lint/test scripts if additional checks (e.g., `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`) need enabling (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

- Token values (colors, typography, spacing) are defined in `docs/design-spec.md`; map each to Tailwind theme extensions. [Source: docs/design-spec.md]  
- shadcn/ui setup instructions reference the official CLI; ensure generated components are checked into `components/ui` and align with Next.js app router usage. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]  
- Accessibility expectations (focus rings, ARIA patterns, testing requirements) are noted in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; adhere to them for every component. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]  
- Provide example usage in Storybook-style markdown or component README to guide future developers; Storybook itself can be deferred but document pattern clearly. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-design-system.md]  
- Coordinate with Story 1.1 and 2.1 owners to ensure new components integrate seamlessly (e.g., Button variants reused in auth forms and dashboard CTAs). [Source: docs/prd.md]

### Testing

- Use Vitest + React Testing Library per `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for interactive component states (hover, focus, loading).  
- Add visual regression or snapshot tests to guard against token changes.  
- Include manual accessibility checklist results in the Dev Notes and failure follow-ups in QA logs.

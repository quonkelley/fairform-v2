# Story 3.1: Design System Foundations

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** front-end developer,  
**I want** a shared design system with reusable components and accessibility baked in,  
**so that** I can build FairForm features quickly and consistently without reimplementing UI primitives.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tailwind config exports FairForm brand tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows as defined in the design spec.  
2. `shadcn/ui` is installed and configured with tree-shakable exports, ready for component generation.  
3. `Button` component covers primary, ghost/secondary, disabled, loading states with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard focus indicators.  
4. `Card` and `FormField` components exist and are reusable for authentication and dashboard flows.  
5. Typography scale (headings, body, captions) is documented and applied globally (e.g., via CSS variables or Tailwind theme) to match the design specification.  
6. Automated (linting, unit) and manual accessibility checks confirm WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for the base components (focus order, contrast, keyboard navigation).  
7. Design system documentation/README describes component usage patterns and references design tokens.

## Dev Notes

### **Implementation Status Update**
**Current State:** 100% of design system implementation is complete. All core components, styling, accessibility features, documentation, and testing are fully implemented and functional.

### **Completed Implementation Details**
- **Tailwind Configuration:** `tailwind.config.ts` includes FairForm brand colors, typography scale (Inter font), spacing, and shadow tokens [Source: tailwind.config.ts]
- **shadcn/ui Setup:** Fully configured with 9 UI components in `components/ui/` including Button, Card, FormField, and supporting primitives [Source: components/ui/]
- **Component Library:** All required components implemented with proper variants, ARIA attributes, and accessibility features [Source: components/ui/button.tsx, card.tsx, form.tsx]
- **Global Styles:** Typography and design tokens applied via CSS variables in `app/globals.css` [Source: app/globals.css]

### **Completed Work Summary**
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive design system documentation created with usage examples and API documentation
- **Accessibility Audit:** Formal testing and compliance verification completed with automated linting and manual audit
- **Component Testing:** Complete unit test suite for design system components and accessibility features

### **Technical References**
- Token values (colors, typography, spacing) are defined in `docs/design-spec.md` and implemented in Tailwind config [Source: docs/design-spec.md]  
- shadcn/ui components are properly configured and tree-shakable [Source: components.json, components/ui/]  
- Accessibility expectations (focus rings, ARIA patterns, testing requirements) are noted in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]  
- Components are already integrated with Stories 1.1 and 2.1 (auth forms and dashboard) [Source: app/(auth)/, app/dashboard/]

### Testing

- Use Vitest + React Testing Library per `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for interactive component states (hover, focus, loading).  
- Add visual regression or snapshot tests to guard against token changes.  
- Include manual accessibility checklist results in the Dev Notes and failure follow-ups in QA logs.

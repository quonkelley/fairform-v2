# Story 13.26: AI Copilot Terminology Standardization

## Status
üìã Backlog - Created October 15, 2025

## Story
**As a** FairForm user,
**I want** consistent terminology across all AI Copilot entry points,
**so that** I have a clear, unified understanding of what the AI assistant is and how to access it.

## Context

Following the UX simplification (removal of Quick Form Intake), we discovered inconsistent terminology across different touch points:

**Current Inconsistencies:**
- Desktop navigation: "Talk to FairForm"
- Mobile navigation: "AI Assistant"
- Empty state CTA: "Talk to FairForm"
- Component names: `AICopilot`, `ChatPanel`, etc.
- Internal references: "Copilot", "AI Assistant", "FairForm Assistant"

**Problem:**
Users may be confused when different parts of the app use different names for the same feature. This creates cognitive friction and reduces discoverability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Single primary term chosen and documented for the AI assistant feature
2. All user-facing text updated to use consistent terminology
3. Navigation labels (desktop & mobile) use same terminology
4. CTAs and buttons use consistent language
5. Internal code comments/documentation reference the agreed terminology
6. Brand voice maintained across all entry points
7. Accessibility labels (ARIA) use consistent terminology
8. Mobile and desktop experiences use identical terms

## Proposed Options

### Option A: "AI Assistant" (Descriptive & Clear)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Immediately clear what it is
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard term
- ‚úÖ Accessible language (no jargon)
- ‚úÖ Works well on mobile (shorter)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Generic, less branded
- ‚ùå Less conversational tone

**Usage Examples:**
- "Talk to AI Assistant"
- Navigation: "AI Assistant"
- Button: "Open AI Assistant"
- Mobile: "AI Assistant"

### Option B: "Talk to FairForm" (Conversational & Branded)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Warm, conversational tone
- ‚úÖ Reinforces brand (FairForm = helpful guide)
- ‚úÖ Implies conversation/dialogue
- ‚úÖ Unique to FairForm

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Longer text (mobile space constraints)
- ‚ùå Less immediately clear it's AI
- ‚ùå Navigation label might be awkward ("Talk to FairForm" as nav item)

**Usage Examples:**
- Empty state: "Talk to FairForm"
- Navigation: "FairForm Assistant" or "Chat with FairForm"
- Button: "Talk to FairForm"
- Mobile: "FairForm" or "Chat"

### Option C: "FairForm Copilot" (Technical & Branded)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Matches internal naming conventions
- ‚úÖ "Copilot" is trendy tech term (GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Implies AI assistance

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå "Copilot" may confuse non-technical users
- ‚ùå Longer text
- ‚ùå Less accessible to general audience

### Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

**Primary Term:** "AI Assistant"
**Conversational Variant:** "Talk to FairForm"

**Usage Guidelines:**
- **Navigation (Desktop & Mobile):** "AI Assistant" (clear, scannable)
- **Empty State CTA:** "Talk to FairForm" (warm, inviting)
- **Buttons/Icons:** "AI Assistant" or icon with "Chat" tooltip
- **Help Text:** "Our AI Assistant can help you..."
- **Internal Code:** Keep `AICopilot` component names (no refactor needed)

This balances clarity with conversational warmth while maintaining brand voice.

## Dev Notes

### Current Touch Points

**Need Terminology Updates:**
1. `components/layouts/AppHeader.tsx` (lines ~45, ~110)
   - Desktop nav: "Talk to FairForm"
   - Mobile nav: "AI Assistant"

2. `components/dashboard/empty-state.tsx` (line ~30)
   - Primary CTA: "Talk to FairForm"

3. Potential other locations:
   - Dashboard help text
   - Settings page references
   - Onboarding/tutorial text
   - Error messages mentioning the assistant

### Implementation Strategy

**Low-Risk Approach:**
1. Start with navigation (most visible)
2. Then update CTAs and buttons
3. Finally update help text and documentation
4. Use find-and-replace carefully (avoid breaking internal code)

**Code Impact:**
- Minimal code changes (mostly string literals)
- No component refactoring needed
- No breaking changes to functionality
- Test existing features after text updates

### Terminology Reference Document (To Create)

# Story 5.1: Authenticated Layout and Navigation

## Status
Done

## Story

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**
- Database and API layer is complete with secure authentication (Epic 4)
- Firebase Auth integration is working with server-side validation
- Design system components (Button, Card, Form) are available (Epic 3)
- Dashboard components exist but need layout wrapper (Epic 2)
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library is established

### **Component Specifications**
- **Layout Structure**: Use Next.js App Router layout pattern with `layout.tsx` files [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#app]
- **Header Component**: Sticky header with navigation menu, max-width 960px container [Source: design-system.md#layout-guidelines]
- **Navigation Links**: Use Next.js `Link` component with `usePathname()` for active state [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Button Variants**: Use `ghost` variant for nav links, `outline` for secondary actions [Source: design-system.md#button]
- **Mobile Menu**: Consider hamburger menu for mobile if nav items exceed comfortable width

### **File Locations**
- Layout wrapper: `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` (wraps all authenticated routes) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#app]
- Header component: `components/layouts/AppHeader.tsx` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#components]
- Footer component: `components/layouts/AppFooter.tsx` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#components]
- Navigation utilities: Import from existing auth context in `components/auth/auth-context.tsx`

### **Design System Integration**
- **Colors**: Use `primary` for active nav items, `muted-foreground` for inactive [Source: design-system.md#colors]
- **Typography**: H1 for page titles (text-3xl font-bold), body text for nav items [Source: design-system.md#typography]
- **Spacing**: Use `md` (24px) spacing between nav items, `lg` (32px) for section padding [Source: design-system.md#spacing]
- **Focus Indicators**: Use design system focus ring styles for keyboard navigation [Source: design-system.md#accessibility-features]
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile, 48x48px recommended for primary actions [Source: design-system.md#touch-targets]

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
- **Mobile**: 360px-767px (4-column grid, stacked navigation) [Source: design-system.md#grid-system]
- **Tablet**: 768px-1023px (8-column grid, horizontal navigation) [Source: design-system.md#grid-system]
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (12-column grid, full horizontal navigation) [Source: design-system.md#grid-system]
- Use Tailwind breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### **Authentication Integration**
- Import `useAuth()` hook from `components/auth/auth-context.tsx` [Source: previous Story 1.1]
- Access `user` object for display name/email in header
- Use `signOut()` method from Firebase Auth for logout action [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#auth]
- Redirect to `/login` after logout using Next.js router

### **Accessibility Requirements**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All interactive elements must meet contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text) [Source: coding-standards.md#accessibility]
- **Semantic HTML**: Use `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` elements [Source: design-system.md#accessibility-standards]
- **ARIA Labels**: Add `aria-current="page"` to active nav item [Source: design-system.md#accessibility-standards]
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Logical tab order, visible focus indicators, skip-to-content link [Source: design-system.md#keyboard-navigation]
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper landmark roles and descriptive labels [Source: design-system.md#screen-reader-support]

### **Testing Requirements**
- Component tests with ≥80% coverage for layout components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing]
- Use Vitest with React Testing Library for unit tests [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing]
- Add jest-axe tests for accessibility validation [Source: design-system.md#testing-components]
- Test keyboard navigation with focus management assertions
- Test responsive behavior at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

### **Technical Constraints**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled - all components must be properly typed [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#general]
- Use functional components with hooks - no class components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#general]
- Keep components presentational - complex logic in custom hooks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#ui-components]
- Follow repository pattern - no direct Firestore calls from UI [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#general]

### **Navigation Structure**
```
Header
├─ Logo/Brand
├─ Navigation Menu
│  ├─ Dashboard (/)
│  ├─ Settings (/settings) - future
│  └─ [User Menu]
│     ├─ Profile
│     └─ Logout
└─ [Mobile Menu Toggle]
```

### **Implementation Pattern**
```tsx
// Example layout structure
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <AppHeader />
      <main className="flex-1 container mx-auto px-4 py-8 max-w-[960px]">
        {children}
      </main>
      <AppFooter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Testing

- Use Vitest + React Testing Library per `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.
- Add jest-axe for automated accessibility testing.
- Test component rendering, navigation functionality, and active states.
- Test keyboard navigation: Tab order, focus indicators, skip-to-content.
- Test responsive behavior at 360px, 768px, and 1280px viewports.
- Manual testing with screen reader for ARIA compliance.

# Story 1.1: Authentication Foundations

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** self-represented litigant,  
**I want** to create an account and securely access my dashboard,  
**so that** I can save my case information and continue where I left off.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can sign up with email and password; invalid inputs show inline errors.
2. Users can log in, log out, and remain authenticated after refreshing the browser.
3. Password reset is available via email link.
4. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated visitors to the login page.
5. Authentication success and failure states surface accessible toast or inline messaging.
6. Login and sign-up screens meet WCAG 2.1 AA (focus order, labels, contrast).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Configure Firebase project and environment variables (AC: 1,2,3)
  - [x] Populate `.env.local` from `.env.example` with Firebase keys (AC: 1,2)
  - [x] Verify Vercel env variable configuration for staging (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Build sign-up, login, and password reset pages in Next.js App Router (AC: 1,2,3,6)
  - [x] Implement forms using `react-hook-form` and Zod schemas (AC: 1,3)
  - [x] Add accessible labels, focus traps, and error messaging (AC: 1,6)
- [x] Integrate Firebase Auth client and session persistence (AC: 2,4)
  - [x] Create reusable auth guard / middleware for protected routes (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement toast notifications for auth flows (AC: 5)
- [x] Write unit and integration tests for auth flows (AC: 1â€“6)
  - [x] Component tests for login/signup forms (AC: 1,6)
  - [x] API/mock tests ensuring redirects for unauthenticated access (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes

- Use Next.js App Router pages at `app/(auth)/login` and `app/(auth)/signup`; ensure layout wrappers use design system components. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- Firebase Auth initialization lives in `lib/firebase.ts`; reuse across repository calls. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Protect authenticated routes via middleware or higher-order guard that checks Firebase session cookies before rendering dashboard pages. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All user-facing text must align with FairForm tone guidelines (empathetic, educational). [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-authentication-system.md]
- Configure toast notifications using shadcn/ui `useToast` helper to ensure consistent styling and accessibility. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-design-system.md]

### Testing

- Follow Vitest + React Testing Library standards outlined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.
- Validate form submissions with happy path and error states, including password reset email failure handling.
- Add integration test ensuring protected route responds with redirect for unauthenticated requests.

# Story 15.2: Case Import Card & Pipeline

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** FairForm demo presenter,  
**I want** the Case Import card to process eviction notice uploads or quick manual entry,  
**so that** the demo seamlessly produces a ready-to-review case with resilient user feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Case Import card supports drag-and-drop and file picker upload, showing simulated scan progress, success, and error states with accessible messaging.
2. Successful notice upload invokes `parseDemoNotice`, resets demo repositories, creates the imported case, and routes to the case dashboard while Copilot logs acknowledge the import.
3. Manual entry fallback form allows presenters to input case metadata; submissions follow the same repository update path and surface confirmation UI.
4. A replacement confirmation appears when the presenter imports a second notice in-session, ensuring `resetDemoStorage()` is called before applying new data.
5. Console instrumentation logs `"case-import:start"`, `"case-import:success"`, and `"case-import:error"` with timing details for walk-through rehearsals.
6. RTL and Playwright specs cover upload happy path, invalid file errors, manual fallback submission, and replacement confirmation flow.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Build Case Import Card scaffolding (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `components/demo/CaseImportCard.tsx` with shadcn card primitives
  - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop plus file picker triggers with keyboard support
  - [ ] Render scanning progress and skeleton states during simulated delay
  - [ ] Surface accessible error messaging and retry affordances
- [ ] Task 2: Wire upload pipeline to parser (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Invoke `parseDemoNotice` with selected filename and guard unknown files
  - [ ] On success, call `resetDemoStorage()` then seed `demoCasesRepo` and `demoStepsRepo`
  - [ ] Navigate to case dashboard and emit Copilot acknowledgement event hook
  - [ ] Handle parser error result without throwing, reverting UI state gracefully
- [ ] Task 3: Implement manual entry fallback (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add quick-entry form toggled inside import card for manual metadata
  - [ ] Map manual data into the same seeding flow as parser success
  - [ ] Validate required fields with inline feedback and keyboard focus management
- [ ] Task 4: Add replace-case confirmation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Detect when repositories already contain an imported demo case
  - [ ] Prompt presenter with confirmation modal before overwriting case data
  - [ ] Ensure confirmation path resets storage and replays import flow
- [ ] Task 5: Instrument logging and timing (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add `console.info` markers for start/success/error plus elapsed milliseconds
  - [ ] Document usage in story notes for demo rehearsal scripting
- [ ] Task 6: Testing and validation coverage (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add RTL tests for upload success, parser error, manual fallback submit, and confirmation path
  - [ ] Update Playwright scenario for upload-to-dashboard journey with screenshot assertion
  - [ ] Record lint/typecheck commands in Dev Notes for developer handoff

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 15.1 establishes the parser utility and fixture; consume its typed result without revalidating JSON beyond schema checks returned by the parser.

### Data Models
- Repository seeding must hydrate `cases` and `caseSteps` maps with fields defined for demo scenarios (case metadata, ordered steps). [Source: docs/architecture/data-model.md:11]

### API Specifications
- No external APIs are invoked; maintain repository interactions inside demo utilities. No additional architecture guidance provided.

### Component Specifications
- Demo architecture enforces resilient UI states (loading, empty, error) for every surface; implement progress, success, and error views within the card. [Source: docs/architecture/DEMO-ARCHITECTURE-ROBUST.md:7]

### File Locations
- Place the card under `components/demo/` to align with demo feature modules, and keep demo repository helpers within `lib/demo/**`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md:15]
- Route-handling and repo utilities should remain in `lib/demo` modules, mirroring existing scenario layout. [Source: docs/architecture/DEMO-ARCHITECTURE-ROBUST.md:31]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing and avoid `any` usage for component props and handler results. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:6]
- UI components should remain presentational with complex logic extracted to hooks/utilities, keeping repository calls outside JSX render paths. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md:26]
- Respect repository abstraction; UI must not access Firestore directly and should rely on demo repo interfaces. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md:7]

### Project Structure Notes
- Ensure navigation and instrumental hooks reuse existing demo helpers; no structural conflicts identified with current source tree.

#### Testing
- Use Vitest + RTL for component tests and Playwright for end-to-end flows as defined in the testing stack. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:10]
- Follow testing standards requiring coverage of critical demo flows and interaction cases. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md:38]

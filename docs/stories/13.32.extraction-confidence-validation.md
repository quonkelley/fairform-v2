# Story 13.32: Extraction Confidence & Validation UI

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Story
**As a** user whose information was automatically extracted,
**I want** to see confidence scores and easily correct mistakes,
**so that** I trust the AI and my case has accurate information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Shows amber warning icon for fields with <70% confidence
2. Provides inline "Edit" button for each extracted field
3. Displays "Looks good?" confirmation for borderline extractions (70-80% confidence)
4. Clicking Edit opens inline input field
5. Tracks user corrections to improve future extractions
6. Visual design clearly distinguishes high vs. low confidence
7. Accessible (screen reader announces confidence levels)
8. Mobile-friendly editing experience

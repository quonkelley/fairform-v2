# Sprint 2 Completion & Sprint 3 Alignment

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Owner:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Purpose:** Align team on Sprint 2 completion priorities and Sprint 3 planning approach

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 2 is **50% complete** with Stories 6.1 and 6.2 successfully delivered. To maintain project integrity and quality standards, we need to **complete Sprint 2 before committing to Sprint 3** scope.

This document addresses the alignment gap between our current Sprint 2 status and the excellent Sprint 3 planning work done by the ChatGPT team.

**Key Decisions:**
1. ‚úÖ Complete Stories 6.3 & 6.4 before Sprint 2 close
2. ü§î Make Epic 7 (Glossary) prioritization decision after 6.3/6.4 complete
3. üìã Revise Sprint 3 scope to prioritize lower-risk, high-value features
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Consider deferring AI features (Epic 12) to Sprint 4 for proper compliance review

---

## 2. Sprint 2 Remaining Work

### Story 6.3: Step Detail Modal

**What It Is:**
A modal component that opens when users click a case step, displaying detailed instructions, due date, and estimated time to complete.

**Key Deliverables:**
- `components/case-journey/step-detail-modal.tsx` component
- `lib/data/step-instructions.ts` with hardcoded templates
- Updated `step-node.tsx` with click handler
- Comprehensive test suite

**Technical Approach:**
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog component (already installed)
- Hardcoded instruction templates for 5 Small Claims steps
- Focus trap, keyboard navigation (ESC to close)
- Mobile-responsive design (full-width on mobile)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Click step ‚Üí modal opens with instructions
2. Modal shows step name, instructions, due date
3. Dismissible (X button, ESC, click outside)
4. Keyboard accessible (Tab, ESC)
5. Screen reader compatible
6. Mobile-friendly design

**Testing Requirements:**
- Component tests (modal open/close, content display)
- Accessibility tests (jest-axe, keyboard nav)
- Integration tests (click step ‚Üí modal opens)
- Responsive tests (mobile/tablet/desktop)

---

### Story 6.4: Dashboard Progress Sync

**What It Is:**
Progress calculation and display on dashboard case cards, showing users their completion percentage at a glance.

**Key Deliverables:**
- `calculateCaseProgress()` function in `casesRepo.ts`
- Updated `CaseCard` component with progress bar
- Progress calculation triggered on step completion
- React Query cache invalidation for dashboard updates

**Technical Approach:**
- Add progress fields to Case interface: `progressPct`, `totalSteps`, `completedSteps`

- Update on step completion (server-side calculation)
- Use shadcn/ui Progress component
- ARIA attributes for accessibility

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Dashboard cards show progress percentage (0-100%)
2. Progress bar provides visual indicator
3. Updates within 1s of step completion
4. Accurate calculation
5. Empty state handled (0% shows gracefully)
6. Accessible with proper ARIA attributes

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests (progress calculation edge cases)
- Component tests (progress bar display)
- Integration tests (complete step ‚Üí dashboard updates)
- Accessibility tests (ARIA attributes, screen reader)

---

### Sprint 2 Definition of Done

Sprint 2 is complete when:

- [ ] Stories 6.3 & 6.4 delivered and tested
- [ ] All tests passing (current 59 + new tests for 6.3/6.4)
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations maintained
- [ ] QA gates passed for both stories
- [ ] Case Journey Map fully functional (all 4 stories)
- [ ] Dashboard progress sync working end-to-end
- [ ] Sprint review conducted
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Estimated Completion:** 3.5 days of focused development

---

## 3. Epic 7 Decision Required

### The Question
**When should we implement Epic 7 (Inline Glossary)?**

Epic 7 has a complete PRD (`docs/prd/epic-7-inline-glossary.md`) and was mentioned in the Sprint 2 plan but not included in current work.

### Options

**Option 1: Include in Sprint 2**
- Extends Sprint 2 by 2-3 days
- Epic 6 complete, glossary integrated with step instructions
- Maintains sprint continuity

**Pros:**
- Delivers complete user experience (journey + glossary)
- High user value (clarifies legal terms)
- Natural integration point with step instructions

**Cons:**
- Delays Sprint 3 start
- Increases Sprint 2 scope mid-sprint
- Team may be fatigued after 4 stories

---

**Option 2: Create Sprint 2.5 Mini-Sprint**
- Dedicated 2-3 day sprint for Epic 7 only
- Clean boundaries between sprints
- Focused delivery

**Pros:**
- Delivers Epic 7 without extending Sprint 2
- Clear sprint boundaries
- Maintains team momentum

**Cons:**
- Adds another sprint to schedule
- May feel like artificial separation
- Delays Sprint 3 by 2-3 days anyway

---

**Option 3: Defer to Sprint 3 or Later**
- Focus Sprint 3 on other features first
- Implement glossary when team has capacity
- Consider user feedback on Epic 6 first

**Pros:**
- Sprint 2 closes on time (3.5 days)
- Sprint 3 can start with fresh scope
- Allows prioritization of other features

**Cons:**
- Users experience step instructions without glossary help
- Glossary implementation may be less integrated later
- User value delayed

---

### Recommendation

**Make decision after Stories 6.3 & 6.4 complete.**

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Team Velocity:** Are we ahead or behind the 3.5 day estimate?
2. **Team Energy:** Is the team ready for more Sprint 2 work or need a break?
3. **User Feedback:** Do early users request glossary feature immediately?
4. **Sprint 3 Priorities:** Is Sprint 3 scope more urgent than Epic 7?

**Lean Toward:** Option 3 (defer to Sprint 3+) unless team is ahead of schedule and Epic 7 is critical for user success.

---

## 4. Sprint 3 Prerequisites

Before starting Sprint 3 with AI features (as proposed in ChatGPT team's plan), we must ensure:

### Must-Have Prerequisites

## 5. Sprint 3 Scope Feedback

### Appreciation for ChatGPT Team's Work

The ChatGPT team has done **excellent forward-thinking work** on Sprint 3 planning:

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Comprehensive Sprint 3 backlog with clear estimates
- Detailed integration summary showing cross-epic dependencies
- Strong QA gate document with compliance focus
- Thorough tech spike plan for AI infrastructure
- Well-structured epic PRDs (especially Epic 12)

‚úÖ **Quality Indicators:**
- Evidence of systems thinking (integration document)
- Compliance awareness (moderation, disclaimers, logging)
- QA rigor (comprehensive gate criteria)
- BMAD method adherence (process followed well)

---

### Concerns About Proposed Sprint 3 Scope

‚ùì **Complexity Jump:**
- Sprint 2: UI features (timelines, modals, progress bars)
- Sprint 3 Proposed: **AI-powered features** (classification, moderation, compliance)
- This represents a significant technical and compliance complexity increase

‚ùì **Risk Profile:**
- Sprint 2 Features: Low risk (UI, forms, data display)
- AI Features: **High risk** (UPL concerns, API dependencies, moderation requirements)

‚ùì **Epic Sequence:**
- Sprint 3 proposes: Epic 10, 11, 12 (skipping Epic 7, 8, 9)
- Epic 9 (Reminders) builds notification infrastructure needed for other features
- Why skip to Epic 12 (highest complexity) instead of Epic 9 (medium complexity)?

‚ùì **Prerequisites Not Met:**
- AI compliance review status unclear
- OpenAI API not mentioned in current docs
- Feature flag strategy not documented
- Moderation layer not yet validated

---

### Alternative Sprint 3 Approach

**Recommendation: Focus on Lower-Risk, High-Value Features First**

**Proposed Sprint 3 Scope:**
1. **Epic 9: Reminders System** (5-6 days)
   - Email reminders via Resend
   - SMS reminders via Twilio
   - Builds notification infrastructure
   - Lower risk than AI features
   - High user value (deadline tracking)

2. **Epic 10: Day-in-Court Checklist** (2-3 days)
   - Interactive pre-hearing checklist
   - Case type specific templates
   - LocalStorage persistence (MVP)
   - Low complexity, quick win

3. **Epic 11: User Settings** (1.5-2 days)
   - Settings page scaffold
   - Notification preferences
   - AI opt-in toggle (prep for Epic 12)
   - Foundation for future features

**Total: 9-11 days** (vs. 14 days in original Sprint 3 plan)

**Benefits:**
- More manageable scope (9-11 vs 14 days)
- Lower risk profile (medium vs high risk features)
- Builds infrastructure for future AI features
- Delivers immediate user value
- Maintains quality standards

---

**Proposed Sprint 4: AI-Ready with Proper Foundation**

1. **AI Tech Spike** (1.5 days)
   - Moderation, schema, feature flags
   - Infrastructure tested and validated

2. **Epic 12: AI Intake** (8-9 days)
   - With full compliance review complete
   - Legal disclaimers approved
   - Moderation validated
   - Proper prerequisites met

**Total: 10-11 days** with solid foundation

---

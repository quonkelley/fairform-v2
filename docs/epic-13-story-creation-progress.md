**Scope Addition Rationale:** Based on UX review, Epic 13's "Seamless Case Creation" goal (mentioned in PRD but missing implementation stories) now has dedicated stories. These bridge the conversational Copilot experience with actual case creation, completing the epic's original vision of conversational intake.

## 🏗️ Architecture Context

**Epic 13 transforms FairForm's AI intake into a persistent, context-aware conversational system** - the AI Copilot. This architecture has been validated by multiple teams and approved for implementation.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- ✅ Maintains FairForm's repository pattern
- ✅ Uses subcollection pattern for message storage
- ✅ Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses
- ✅ Separate Firebase project for demo isolation
- ✅ Context snapshots with fingerprinting for performance
- ✅ Comprehensive security and compliance framework

**Source Documents:**
- **PRD:** `docs/prd/epic-13-ai-copilot.md`
- **Architecture:** `docs/epic-13-unified-architecture-specification.md`
- **Config:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`

---

## 📁 Story File Locations

All stories are located in: `docs/stories/`

**File Naming Pattern:** `13.{number}.{story-title-short}.md`

**Examples:**
- `docs/stories/13.1.ai-sessions-repository.md`
- `docs/stories/13.2.chat-api-sse-streaming.md`
- `docs/stories/13.3.context-builder-fingerprinting.md`
- etc.

## 🎯 Next Steps for Scrum Master

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Continue creating remaining stories** (13.14 - 13.20)
2. **Follow established story template** from `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`
3. **Reference architecture specification** for technical details
4. **Maintain consistency** with existing story structure

**Story Creation Process:**
1. Read the architecture specification for technical context
2. Create story following the template structure
3. Include comprehensive Dev Notes with architecture references
4. Add detailed Tasks/Subtasks with acceptance criteria mapping
5. Include testing requirements and source tree information

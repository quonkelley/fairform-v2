# AI Copilot Conversation Context Fix

## Problem Identified

The AI Copilot was giving repetitive greetings and not maintaining conversation context. Each message was being treated as a brand new conversation with no memory of previous exchanges.

### Root Causes

1. **No Conversation History in OpenAI Calls**: The chat route was only sending the current user message to OpenAI, not the full conversation history
2. **Demo Endpoint Had No State Management**: The demo mode used simple keyword matching with no memory
3. **Context Builder Not Utilized**: A context builder existed but was never called

## Changes Made

### 1. Demo Endpoint (`app/api/ai/copilot/demo/route.ts`)

**Added conversation state management:**
- In-memory state tracking per session
- Stage-based conversation flow (greeting → intake → details → guidance)
- Case type detection (eviction, small claims)
- Contextual responses based on conversation stage

**Conversation Flow:**
```
Greeting → User mentions case type
  ↓
Intake → Acknowledge case type, ask for basic details
  ↓
Details → Provide detailed guidance and next steps
  ↓
Guidance → Ongoing assistance, resources, court prep
```

### 2. Main Chat Route (`app/api/ai/copilot/chat/route.ts`)

**Added conversation history to OpenAI calls:**
- Now retrieves last 10 messages from session history
- Includes them in the OpenAI API call in chronological order
- Works for both SSE streaming and JSON fallback modes

**Changes in both `handleSSEResponse()` and `handleJSONResponse()`:**
```typescript
// Before: Only current message
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: buildSystemPrompt() },
  { role: "user", content: userMessage }
];

// After: Full conversation history
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: buildSystemPrompt() }
];
// Add last 10 messages from history
const messageHistory = await listMessages(session.id, { limit: 10 });
for (const msg of messageHistory.items.reverse()) {
  messages.push({ role: msg.author, content: msg.content });
}
// Then add current message
messages.push({ role: "user", content: userMessage });
```

## Testing the Fix

### Demo Mode Test Flow

1. Open AI Copilot
2. Say "Hi" - Get greeting
3. Say "Eviction case" - Should acknowledge eviction and ask for details
4. Say "Just got a letter on my door" - Should provide detailed eviction guidance

**Expected behavior:** Each response builds on previous messages, no repetitive greetings

### Production Mode Test Flow

If you have OpenAI API key configured:
1. Same test flow as demo
2. Conversation should be even more natural with GPT-4o-mini
3. History is maintained in Firestore and included in each API call

## Deployment

### Current Status
- Changes are in local files
- No linter errors
- Ready to commit and deploy

### To Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit changes
git add app/api/ai/copilot/
git commit -m "Fix AI Copilot conversation context - maintain chat history"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

### Verification After Deployment

1. Open deployed app
2. Test the conversation flow with AI Copilot
3. Verify it doesn't repeat greetings
4. Confirm it progresses through: greeting → intake → details → guidance

## Technical Details

### Demo Mode State Management

Uses an in-memory Map to track conversation state per session:
```typescript
const demoConversationState = new Map<string, {
  stage: 'greeting' | 'intake' | 'details' | 'guidance';
  caseType?: string;
  context: string[];
}>();
```

**Note:** Demo state is in-memory only and will reset on server restart. For persistent conversations, the production mode stores all messages in Firestore.

### Production Mode History Retrieval

Retrieves last 10 messages from Firestore and includes them in OpenAI API calls:
- Older conversations are automatically summarized
- Token limits are respected
- History maintains proper role attribution (user/assistant)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Context**: Integrate the `contextBuilder.ts` to include:
   - Case data (type, jurisdiction, progress)
   - User preferences (tone, complexity)
   - Journey-specific templates

2. **Intake Integration**: Connect to the structured intake API (`/api/ai/intake`) for formal case creation

3. **Journey Templates**: Load case journey templates to guide conversations toward specific outcomes

4. **Smart Summarization**: When conversations get long, summarize older messages to stay within token limits

## Files Modified

- `app/api/ai/copilot/demo/route.ts` - Added state management and stage-based conversation flow
- `app/api/ai/copilot/chat/route.ts` - Added conversation history to OpenAI API calls

## No Breaking Changes

These changes are backward compatible:
- Existing sessions continue to work
- No database schema changes
- No new environment variables required
- Gracefully handles missing history (new conversations)
